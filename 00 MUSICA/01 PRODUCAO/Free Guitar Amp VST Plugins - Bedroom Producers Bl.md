This article lists **free guitar amp VST plugins**. For more music software, return to Free VST Plugins.

Whether you’re a guitar player or not, it can be useful to have a good guitar amp emulator or two in your plugins folder. Must like a good saturator, guitar amps can color a sound, adding anything from subtle warmth to full-on distortion. If you’re a guitar player without access to a sound-proof studio, these kinds of VSTs are essential for bringing DI’ed signals to life. However, they can work well on synthesizers, drum machines, samples—pretty much anything that needs an injection of saturation.

This list focuses on guitar amplifier sims. While some may contain cabs (speakers or cabinets), many are just the head. Many offer multiple amp types and are capable of providing several different kinds of tones. If you’re new to the world of guitar amps, it can be useful to experiment and see what works best for your type of music.
