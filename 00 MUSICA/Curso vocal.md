## [Voice Type](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vocal-production/lecture/N5Evj/voice-type)

**bass vocal** type we'll say starts at F2 and goes up to F4.
The **baritone** will play from A2 to A4.
The **tenor** will play from C3 to C5.
**contra alto** voice is from F3 to F5
The **Mezz-Soprano** voice would be from A3 to A5.
And the **soprano** voice would be from C4 to C6 (Good luck, sopranos, hitting that note)
