Searching for a new programming language to learn in 2021? There are many great options out there, but Rust might be one of the best. It’s fun to learn, can improve your skills as a software developer, and has a very welcoming community.

In this article, I will look at why you should learn Rust, list the path I would take to learn it if I were you, and then include resources (all of them free!) that you can use in your journey.

# Why Should You Learn Rust?

I’m not going to say that every software development company in the world is waiting in line to grab new Rust developers. That might be true in a few years or so.

For now, Rust is the best language to grow as a software developer.

First off, working with things like memory management, borrow checker, lifetimes, and the expressive types will undoubtedly make you a better software developer. More than most other programming languages, Rust is good development practices set in stone.

But that’s not all. While Rust is neither Haskell nor Lisp, it has awesome support for all kinds of fun activities like functional programming and macros that you can try out while learning Rust.

Additionally, Rust has a huge community of helpful people and a ton of learning materials. That also counts for something.

# How To Learn Rust

While nobody would fire me for recommending you to start with the official Rust book (and it is a reasonable choice), I think there is a better and more practical way.

Learning the language with just a book is a journey that frequently stops somewhere around the 70th page. Therefore, I believe in accomplishing small things and acquiring practical skills before taking on the long-distance trail that is [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

First off, I suggest checking out one of the introductory Rust tutorials: either [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust)(text), [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/) (interactive), or [Rust Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw) (video). This should get you going with Rust’s syntax and the main philosophy of the language.

Afterward, practice coding with [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) to improve your Rust chops and read a more extensive resource like [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)(standard choice) or [*Easy Rust*](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/) (accessible choice).

If you feel at any point that you are almost ready to build your own toy applications, just go ahead and do it. There are some nice online communities in which you can ask for feedback and support, so don’t be worried about getting stuck!

Below, I cover these and all the other resources you might use while learning Rust — books, tutorials, videos, and more. Each one has a small description so you can decide which are useful for you and which are not.

# Rust Books

## The Rust Programming Language

[*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is the official tome that contains all the basics of the language. If you want to learn Rust, you will find all the information necessary here, and it’s quite a good resource.

## Rust By Example

[*Rust By Example*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) is a collection of runnable examples that cover more or less the same features as the official Rust book. It might be a good place to turn to for examples of how to use a particular feature.

## The Rust Cookbook

[*The Rust Cookbook*](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) contains practical code samples that accomplish some of the basic programming tasks you might do in Rust. The collection does feel rather haphazard, though.

## Easy Rust

[*Easy Rust*](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/) is a book that was originally meant for non-native English speakers, but to be honest, I think that a lot of people will find it easier to learn Rust from it. The official book is a bit dense, and while this book could use a little bit of editing to receive a stellar recommendation, I think it is much more accessible.

# Rust Beginner Tutorials

## A half-hour to learn Rust

There’s zero fluff [in this tutorial](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust). In a time frame that’s rather close to the half-hour mentioned in the title, you will get accustomed to Rust code by going through a lot of different code snippets.

## A Gentle Introduction to Rust

[A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/) is an extensive online tutorial/book written in a very enjoyable way that covers most of the Rust basics.

## Tour of Rust

[Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/) is a fun, interactive tutorial on the basics of Rust. It’s also multi-lingual (available in 15 languages!), which could prove crucial for non-native English speakers.

## Introduction to Rust

If you don’t know a lot about Rust yet, I have written a [small introduction](https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide) that talks about why Rust is cool and what it is used for. It can be useful for gaining more context before using other learning resources.

# Rust Videos

## Rust Crash Course

A concise two-hour video on the basics of Rust that is good for learning its syntax and getting familiar with Rust code.

## Easy Rust

This is a video series that covers the aforementioned book, *Easy Rust*. If you prefer learning from videos, this could be a great alternative to using a book. At the time of writing, the project is not yet complete and covers only one-fifth of the book.

## Crust of Rust

Crust of Rust is a collection of roughly 90-minute videos on more intermediate Rust topics such as lifetimes, iterators, and others. These videos are well presented and quite informative, so I highly suggest checking them out at some point.

# Other Resources

## Exercism

If you want to get more experience and intuition with the language, [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a stellar option. I recommend doing exercises as early as possible since it is a fantastic way to cement concepts and accomplish stuff without agonizing over what things to build.

## Rustlings

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is basically Rust-specific Exercism. In most of the exercises, there is some kind of fault in the code that makes the compiler angry. Your job is to pacify the compiler. It’s great to build intuition on how the Rust compiler works and what the most common code issues are.

## Rust Playground

Too lazy to download the Rust compiler and set it up? You can try out Rust in the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

## Rust Language Cheat Sheet

[Rust Language Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/) is what the name implies. A lot of stuff on Rust on one huge page. You might find it useful as a reference piece while writing code.

## New Rustacean

Though learning a programming language just by listening to podcasts is not the greatest idea ever, [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com/) is an excellent resource to learn or reinforce basic Rust concepts while taking a walk or (less common nowadays) commuting.

## Online communities

Rust has an incredibly welcoming community. You can meet people and ask for advice on [r/Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/), [Slack](https://rust-slack.herokuapp.com/), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aVESxV8). All of them are cool and lively.

# Conclusion

I hope that these resources can help you in your journey. Good luck!
