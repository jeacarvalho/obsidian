esse artigo mostra uma visão de ir aprendendo por estágios: https://dev.to/zhanghandong/learning-rust-you-need-a-cognitive-frame-41oa e sempre balanceando input e output. Ou seja, a cada estágio foque também em projetos


## Stage I: Comprehensive Understanding of the Rust Syntax
### Recommended Study Materials for Stage I
1.  [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/#the-rust-programming-language)
2.  [The Rust Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
3.  Once you have a basic understanding of the Rust syntax, you can test yourself with the official [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) and [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/)

### recommended practice projects.
1.  Combine the official [Command Line Apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html) book to implement a simple terminal application, such as reading a CSV file or something.
2.  Go to the GitHub open source repository for case inspiration.
    1.  for example, implement a terminal typing practice application like [toipe](https://github.com/Samyak2/toipe).
    2.  or a simple editor like [kyun](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/kyun) .

## Stage II: Mastering Key Concepts of the Rust Language
### Recommended Study Materials for Stage II
-   [《Rust for Rustaceans》](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans)
-   [《Programming Rust, Second Edition》](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/)
-   [Rust Design Patterns](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/)
-   Rust Standard Library Documentation
-   [Too Many lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/)

### Recommended practice projects for stage II
- Combine your experience in your domain of expertise and choose simple projects, starting from the simple to the deep.
- At the same time, you can also start reading the source code of some of the better-known projects to start learning.
-   At this point, you can read 《Too Many Lists》 to implement a linked list, or you can solve LeetCode to test your understanding of the Rust ownership mechanism.
-   GitHub project for inspiration, for example:
    -   [smallvec](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec)
    -   [toydb](https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb)
