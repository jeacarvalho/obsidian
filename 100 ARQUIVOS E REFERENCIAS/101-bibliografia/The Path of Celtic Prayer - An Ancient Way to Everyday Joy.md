For when we have drunk deeply of the nature of God, there is born within us a God thirst that can never be slaked by any lesser stream.

Our failure to perceive Christ’s imminent return as our “blessed hope” (Titus 2:13) has contributed to our feelings of separateness from God. The problem is not so much that we seldom think about his coming but that we are no longer excited by the prospect. Paul says there is a crown laid up for all those who love his appearing (2 Timothy 4:8). But do we love and anticipate his appearing? What of our blasé contentment with things as they are, Christless and self-managed? Many of us are secular captives, separated from God and content with the divorce.

In desperate times, living becomes an altar where you pray and sing because the only good news of the day is that God lives longer than you do. And God promises you that even if your days are few, your dying is not a wall, but a set of gates. Beyond this portal lies a reason to esteem your life. God stirs the ashes of your old hopes when you have faced the fact that your lifespan, like that of the Celts, is short. But your prayers endure forever. None of them die.

British writer Ian Smith berated the church for its lack of spiritual vitality: When little is demanded from members, little is given. If commitment requires no more than occasional attendance at Communion, it is not surprising that the average level of participation among members is low. There are large numbers who belong and believe, but contribute very little. In order to grow—indeed, just to stand still—it is essential that the church starts to tap and to mobilize these underutilized resources. The important thing is not only regular attendance at worship but involvement in church activities during the week. How can this level of commitment be achieved? The answer lies in inverting the first principle: when much is demanded from members, much is given.

Behold the Lightener of the Stars      On the crests of the clouds,      And the choralists of the sky      Lauding Him.      Coming down with acclaim      From the Father above,      Harp and lyre of song      Sounding to Him.
