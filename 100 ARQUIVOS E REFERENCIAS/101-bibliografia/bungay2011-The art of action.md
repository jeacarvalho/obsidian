# The Art of Action by Stephen Bungay

One leading Clausewitz scholar has summarized the concept of [[fricção]] as referring to the totality of “uncertainties, errors, accidents, technical difficulties, the unforeseen and their effect on decisions, morale and actions.”


The very business of getting an organization made up of individuals, no matter how disciplined, to pursue a collective goal produces friction just as surely as applying the brakes of a car.


If Clausewitz is right, no one should develop a strategy without taking into account the effects of organizational friction. Yet we continue to be surprised and frustrated when it manifests itself. We tend to think everything has gone wrong when in fact everything has gone normally. The existence of friction is why armies need officers and businesses need managers. Anticipating and dealing with it form the core of [[o trabalho gerencial]]. Recognizing that is liberating in itself.


in 1811, during a lecture he gave at the Berlin War College, Clausewitz referred to “the friction of the whole machinery,” which he divided into two elements: “the numerous chance events, which touch everything”; and “the numerous difficulties which inhibit the accurate execution of the precise plans which theory tends to formulate.”


[[teoria do caos]] Systems are nonlinear when the state they are in at a given point in time provides the input to a feedback mechanism which determines the new state of the system. Some such systems are sensitively dependent on the starting state. If so, future states are unpredictable. Such systems are called “chaotic.” The term is misleading because their states are not random, merely unknowable.


The means of war have an effect on its ends, which are in constant interplay.


The [[informação disponível é imperfeita]] not simply because we do not know what we need to know, but because we know things that are irrelevant. There is not only a lack but a surfeit and the surfeit becomes noise, drowning out what we need and making it ever harder to detect it. Add to uncertain and noisy multiple sources of information the vagaries of transmission and high variation in processing, and we can begin to see why friction should be an inherent feature of any organization, be it an army or a business.


Friction is a function of the finitude of the human condition – the fact that our knowledge is limited and the fact that we are independent agents.


The problem of achieving an organization’s goals is not merely one of getting it to act, but of getting it to act in such a way that what is actually achieved is what was wanted in the first place.


Our plans are imperfect because we lack knowledge. We may not have gathered enough information about the situation or we may have interpreted it wrongly.


Our actions are not always those we plan because it is so difficult to align everybody who needs to act. The message about what we want them to do may not get through, or it may be misunderstood.


And even if we make good plans based on the best information available at the time and people do exactly what we plan, the effects of our actions may not be the ones we wanted because the environment is nonlinear and hence is fundamentally unpredictable.


The knowledge gap gives rise to uncertainty about the nature of the current and future reality


The alignment gap gives rise to uncertainty on the one side about whether people will actually do what we want them to do and on the other side about what exactly the planners want us to do

The effects gap gives rise to uncertainty about what effects our actions are having

These real uncertainties produce general psychological uncertainty.

A gap in knowledge prompts the collection of more data.

A gap in alignment is often indicated by top-level frustration and lower-level confusion.

In their confusion, lower levels imitated the higher ones and identified problems of their own, which resulted in local initiatives. In a complex matrix organization when initiatives come from all directions they usually clash, creating dilemmas over what to do,

A gap in effects is typically responded to by an increase in control. The favorite control mechanism is metrics.

As senior people were constrained by the system to act as if they did not trust people (“I want you to report back to me every week”), so junior people began to mistrust the organization

People become demotivated and keep their attention firmly fixed on their KPIs, which become more important than what they were supposed to measure. Commitment is replaced by compliance, energy is sapped, and morale declines. The end result is a slow, expensive robot.

It was a highly centralized, process-dominated organization, assuming Douglas [[McGregor]]'s Theory X of human motivation.4 It achieved compliance through compulsion.
- MAs a teoria X dele era uma crítica à Taylor...

The French were highly motivated. Their army was, in McGregor’s terms, a “Theory Y” organization. It achieved commitment through conviction.

So it was that the transformation of the Prussian Army began with people and culture, spearheaded by officer selection and training.

“Obedience is a principle,” he memorably asserted, “but the man stands above the principle.”13 Von Moltke wanted to build on the Prussian officer corps’ culture of independent thinking to create an effective system of command, one which also ensured cohesion.

He concluded that it was vital to ensure that every level understood enough of the intentions of the higher command to enable the organization to fulfil its goal.

the chain of command can get disrupted, and some tasks can only be carried out by mixed units put together for the purpose. So a clear chain of command is not enough, nor can processes dominate people. At all levels, people must remain in charge:

For junior officers, discipline means being ready to act on your own initiative in line with the will of your commander. For senior officers, discipline involves maintaining the chain of command,

The higher the level of command, the shorter and more general the orders should be. The next level down should add whatever further specification it feels to be necessary, and the details of execution are left to verbal instructions or perhaps a word of command. This ensures that everyone retains freedom of movement and decision within the bounds of their authority. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de alinhamento]]

The need for secrecy means that one has to be careful about spelling out motives, expectations, and future intentions in orders. However, it is vital that subordinates fully understand the purpose of the order, so that they can carry on trying to achieve it when circumstances demand that they act other than they were ordered to do.

The rule to follow is that an order should contain all, but also only, what subordinates cannot determine for themselves to achieve a particular purpose. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de alinhamento]]

Direction from the highest level should be kept high level. The levels below add appropriate detail. Each level is guided by the intention of the one above, which whenever possible was articulated in a face-to-face briefing as well as in writing. Understanding the context and the overall intention is what enables junior officers to take independent decisions if the specific orders issued to them become invalid because of a change in the situation.

On the knowledge gap, he emphasizes the need to plan only what can be planned, the need for judgment and timely decision making based on what one can ascertain, and the acceptance of uncertainty. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de conhecimento]]

On the alignment gap, he recommends a cascade process with each level adding something to the one above, but all united by an understanding of the intentions of the higher levels.

the higher level should tell the lower level what it needs to know about the situation of the organization as a whole, the overall purpose, the immediate intention of the higher level, the specific role the unit is to play and the roles of other units around it, the freedoms it has, and any constraints it has to observe. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de alinhamento]]

On the effects gap, he encourages the use of individual initiative within boundaries and actually requires junior people to depart from the letter of their instructions if the situation demands it in order to fulfill the intent. Rather than tightening control, he suggests that as long as the intentions of the higher levels are made clear, individual initiative can be relied on to adjust actions according to the situation. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de efeito]]

The insight is that alignment needs to be achieved around intent, and autonomy should be granted around actions. Intent is expressed in terms of what to achieve and why. Autonomy concerns the actions taken in order to realize the intent; in other words, about what to do and how. [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de alinhamento]]

It was an argument between those who wanted to manage chaos by controlling how and those who wanted to exploit chaos by commanding what and why.

One of von Moltke’s acolytes, General von Schlichting, coined the phrase selbstständig denkender Gehorsam – “independent thinking obedience.” The moral and emotional basis of Auftragstaktik was not fear, but respect and [[confiança]].34

In 1877, General Meckel wrote that a directive had two parts. The first was a description of the general situation and the commander’s overall intention; the second was the specific task. Meckel stressed the need for clarity: “Experience suggests,” he wrote, “that every order which can be misunderstood will be.” [[formas de lidar com a lacuna de alinhamento]]

It was clear that if individuals within the organization were to tread the narrow path between the Scylla of rulebook passivity and the Charybdis of random adventurism, and so unify autonomy and alignment, they must also have a shared understanding of how to behave and what they could expect of their peers and their superiors. They needed a common operational doctrine and shared values [[cultura organizacional]]. The organization had to have a high level de [[confiança]].

“a failure to act or a delay is a more serious fault than making a mistake in the choice of means.”

An understanding of intent was the sine qua non of independent action.

The basis of [[liderança]] are the mission (Auftrag) and the situation.

Part of the art of [[liderança]] is to recognize the time and circumstances in which a new decision is called for.

A leader must grant his subordinates freedom of action as long as doing so does not compromise his intention. He must not, however, allow them to make a decision for which he is responsible. [[liderança]]

Adopting mission command as an operating model is not a matter of setting up some processes, but of mastering some skills, perhaps more precisely called “disciplines.” Only when those skills have been mastered can the process be adopted. Taking over the processes without building the skills is simply pouring old wine into new bottles, adopting a dead form. [[lacunas que devemos lidar no dia a dia do trabalho corporativo]]

The name I have chosen for mission command in business is “directed opportunism.”

If they have a clear understanding of purpose, people understand what matters and can react quickly to whatever is unexpected, be it good or bad.

A German officer, confronted by some task, would ask: worauf kommt es eigentlich an? (what is the core of the problem?). An American one, trained in the “engineering approach” to war, would inquire: what are the problem’s component parts?

Mission command embraces a conception of [[liderança]] which unsentimentally places human beings at its center. It crucially depends on factors which do not appear on the balance sheet of an organization: the willingness of people to accept responsibility; the readiness of their superiors to back up their decisions; the tolerance of mistakes made in good faith.[[Times]]

“The aspiration of strategy,” he wrote, is “to achieve the highest end it can with the means available.”

[[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] is a system of expedients. It is more than science, it is the application of knowledge to practical life, the evolution of an original guiding idea under constantly changing circumstances, the art of taking action under the pressure of the most difficult conditions.

Having limited resources, we must make choices about how to deploy them. We cannot do everything.

Doing [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] is a craft which, like all practical skills, can only be mastered through practice, by learning from our own and others’ experience.

Strategy is about fighting the right battles, the important ones you are likely to win. Operations are about winning them.

Operations are about doing things right. They involve reacting to problems and eliminating weaknesses, because in conducting operations you are as strong as the weakest link.

[[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]], in contrast, is about doing the right things. It involves proactively shaping events and investing in strengths, because in creating a strategy you have to make choices, to decide to do some things and not to do others.

Rather than a plan, a [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] is a framework for decision making.

strategy becomes “the evolution of an original guiding idea under constantly changing circumstances.” A strategy is thoughtful, purposive action.

Simpson concludes that the keys to success are “an overall sense of direction and an ability to be flexible.”

We would do well to remember that while a leader’s reputation is ultimately based on success, “how much of it is in fact down to his own efforts is very hard to say.”

Because [[fricção]] is rooted in human [[finitude]], ignoring it is to play at being God. To attribute to CEO-heroes the ability to control events and be immune to good or bad luck is at heart a metaphysical worldview reminiscent of Greek polytheism or even, at the extreme, medieval theology.

A good [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] creates coherence between our capabilities, the opportunities we can detect, and our aims.

Reciprocity pervades not only strategic thinking but decision making and action. Because the effects of our actions depend not merely on what we do but on the actions of other independent wills, strategy will need to adapt to the newly created situations which result.

Doing [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] means thinking, doing, learning, and adapting.

Developing strategy is an intellectual activity. It involves discerning facts and applying rationality. Leadership is a moral activity. It involves relating to people and generating emotional commitment. [[Estratégia x liderança]]

When [[Times]] convince themselves that they have the capability to do something that in fact they do not, just because a lot of other people seem to be doing so, or convince themselves that the market will love the latest thing to pop out of R&D, just because their own engineers love it, [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] fail.

Businesses engage in a vast range of activities. The art of strategic thinking is to identify which of them is the decisive differentiator, the determinant of competitive advantage.


The true strategist is a simplifier of complexity. [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]]

Conviction results from an act of mind which realizes that it is necessary to take a risk and by virtue of that realization creates the will to do so… the sign of a genius for war is the average rate of success.

On analysis, the [[Sexto sentido]] turned out to be perfectly rational. It was based on pattern recognition. Through years of experience in their field, experts build up patterns of expectation, and notice immediately when something unusual occurs which breaks the pattern. These signals make the “right” decision obvious to them.

Insights into the center of gravity of a business and hence innovative strategies tend to come from people of long experience who have an unusual capacity to reflect on that experience in such a way that they become aware of the patterns it shows. Because of this, what to others is a mass of confusing facts is to them a set of clear patterns making the answer to many problems obvious. [[Sexto sentido]]

Essentially, a strategy has to articulate an intent. An [[Intenção]] is the decision to do something now (a task) in order to achieve an outcome (a purpose). Even if we are unsure about the destination, we can specify an end-state; and even if we are unsure about our compass heading, we can specify a next step.

Complexity is the most insidious enemy of execution. If the environment is complex, the temptation is to mirror the complexity internally.

Strategic intent is “stable over time,” and involves capturing “the essence of winning” and setting a target that demands “personal effort and commitment.”

They end with a critique of the reductive, formulaic approach to strategy found in the West, and note that in the 1990s “the challenge will be to enfranchise employees to invent the means to accomplish ambitious ends.”

A [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] intent need not articulate an “animating dream” to be effective. It simply has to provide a coherent framework for action within which the organization develops the strategy as it goes.

the value of [[Intenção]] to provide cohesion in uncertainty.

Intent is a present task informed by a future purpose.

[[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]]
- Orders were to be clear
- Orders were to be precise:
- Orders were to be complete
- Orders were to be short.

Knowing what you want is not enough. You also have to be able to actually set direction. [[Intenção]]

Unless you deliberately practice [[Deliberate practice]] giving direction, you are unlikely to be much good at it, no matter how talented you are.

We need not worry about how to make the structure perfect. However, unless the structure of the organization broadly reflects the structure of the tasks implied by executing the strategy, the [[30 LIDERANCA/Estratégia]] will not be executed. If the structure makes doing some things so difficult that there is a conflict between structure and strategy, the structure will win.

The issue comes down to people. They are both the problem and the answer. Nothing happens unless the key people involved in it want it to, and if the top team does not stand four-squarely behind the strategy, it is doomed. They may not say that they disagree, but if there is a conflict between the strategy and their real convictions, you may as well not start. Curiously, people’s convictions tend to correlate with their interests. Their interests are largely determined by the structure and the compensation system. Both, therefore, must be examined in order to identify and remove any conflicts.

They realized that by defining their boundaries, they were also identifying who they had to talk to in the organization and the outside world.


The core principle of their thinking was to understand “what” and “why,” and the consequences.


Briefing is difficult to do well and has a major impact, for it essentially determines how people are going to spend their time and what outcomes they are going to try to achieve.


A briefing is not a project plan. Plans come afterward. Moreover, it assumes that some planning, at the strategic level, has already been done.


The purpose of briefing is to enable people to act independently.


Briefing is radical in the way in which it unifies effort. The effort is directed toward a desired outcome – everybody has an ultimate goal which is defined in terms of a state of affairs to be attained in the real world. The effort is expressed as action to be taken, a task – something to be done – which will be something which makes a difference.


By defining what really matters, when other things start to get in the way, as they will, people still have the torchlight of intent to guide them.


An important corollary of unity of effort is the emphasis on clarity and simplicity. What matters about creating alignment around a strategy is not the volume of communication, but its quality and precision.


At each level, the starting point is the intent of the level above. Given that context, each unit has to work out its part in the plan, its own “what” and “why.”


the process continued by having each of those team members further specify how they were going to achieve their task. Joe’s “what” – “to accelerate delivery to market of critical products” – would thus become their “why.” Whereas for Joe each of their tasks was an element in how he would achieve his objective, for them it was what they would do.


The steps required to achieve alignment in the context of friction have been famously and memorable enumerated by the Austrian psychologist Konrad Lorenz. Drawing on his observations about what is needed to make people change, we might modify them for an organization as the following: 1 What is said is not yet heard. 2 What is heard is not yet understood. 3 What is understood is not yet believed. 4 What is believed is not yet advocated. 5 What is advocated is not yet acted on. 6 What is acted on is not yet completed.


What ultimately defines understanding is being able to extrapolate implied tasks now and being able to make trade-offs in the future.


Rigor is added here by demanding the explicit articulation of the intention both one and two levels above. In other words, I have to understand both what my boss and their boss in turn are trying to achieve. Everybody understands the intentions of everybody else two levels up in the hierarchy.


Understanding gets compliance. Only belief gets commitment.


After the backbrief, the owner of each task has to brief their own people and cascade the process down. The tasks they identify as constituent of their part in the plan have to be owned by the next level.


As the process cascades down, the tasks become increasingly concrete and specific until no more analysis is necessary or possible.


I have to assess whether or not the situation has changed from when I was first briefed and what that implies about what I ought to do now. I have several stepped options. If there has been a change and I can still fulfill my original part in the plan by modifying what I was planning to do, I carry on. However, if the change is so substantial that I can no longer carry out my original task, or carrying it out no longer makes sense, I should refer back.


Action can begin, but how do we know that it is the right action and when enough is enough? Only if we can measure the effects. It is through measures that we know how to adjust and when a task is completed.


Sins of omission are worse than sins of commission


Von Moltke supervised his high potentials program himself, and spent two weeks of every year from 1858 to 1881 leading 20–40 officers on a staff ride, and so directly influenced the thought processes of the people at the top of his organization.


The result was, von Moltke said, that in a given situation, 99 out of 100 officers would react as he would himself.10

**Note:** Mas então  seriam  robôs  programados  como  sdu modelo ? Um exército  d clones ?


We realise that employees – all of us – won’t always be right, but it is better that they make mistakes than not try to solve customers’ problems.


we want managers to explain why the decision was wrong and what the right decision should have been, so that the next time the employee is confronted with a similar situation he or she will get it right.


People only show independent thinking obedience if they have the means to do so, and are operating within a network of trust.


In the end, the war for talent will be won by the few banks and professional service firms who depend on recruiting A players and therefore pay whatever it takes to get them. Most organizations will by definition mainly employ average people most of the time. The real challenge is how to create an organization which enables average people to turn out above-average performance. The A players are important because, like Moltke’s General Staff, they can act as a multiplier on the performance of the average. What really matters is not the performance of the individual stars but the performance of the collective.


Sometimes, if their subordinates are relatively inexperienced or of low competence, micromanagement may be appropriate. The type of direction and the amount of space given to any subordinate must be appropriate for their particular skills and experience.


The most serious problem is the chronic micromanager who is also an authoritarian. Such individuals micromanage under all circumstances because their psychology leads them to fear uncertainty and seek control.


If you want to change the way people think and act, even if you do not want to found a religion, you need to create disciples to send among the people as well as preaching to the people yourself.


One of the greatest fears of senior people is of letting go and thereby losing direct control. In delegating authority for decision making one gives away power without giving away accountability. A lot of people who do not suffer from the pathology of authoritarians find that a scary thing to do. It implies trusting your people. If you have been brought up to believe that leadership is about knowing how to do something better than your followers, it is difficult to see the task of leaders as enabling followers to perform their jobs better than they otherwise would, and admitting that they may know how to do those jobs better than you do. Letting go is hard to do but can bring great rewards.


There are two dimensions to trust. One is moral – I will trust you if I am confident in your motives. In the end, people who optimize their own interests over those of the collective should depart. We can usually identify them, and a good briefing process will help to flush them into the open. The other is practical – I will trust you if I believe you are competent. Competence is a function of context. I may be quite willing to trust you to drive me to the airport, but not trust you to fly me across the Atlantic. So it is up to me to create a context in which I can trust you.


Using an effective briefing technique renders the motivational task of leadership far easier by making the connection between the individual and the collective, and forming the basis of mutual respect.


the behavior exhibited by groups of actors in organizations is a function of their goals, their resources, and the constraints under which they operate, as illustrated in Figure 16.


To get them to deliver what we want, we need to modify some or all of the variables in the system, watch what happens, and carry on modifying them until we get the behavior which achieves the effects we are after.


one of the challenges of strategy execution is to meet not only the company’s objectives, but the objectives of the people who work in it as well.


Only if the two are aligned and mutually supportive will employees feel commitment.


The more objectives someone has, the harder it is for them to focus on what really matters and the more their freedom of action is constrained.

As the word itself suggests, organizations are organic. They are human systems and only work if the people in them can trust each other’s judgment.

As advances in technology over the last 15 years or so have allowed the collection and dissemination of ever more measures, adoration has turned into infatuation. Infatuation leads to perversity. Metrics become an end in themselves, and get separated from what it was they were intended to measure in the first place. They become a fetish.


Unless the “what” and the “why” are clear, the fetishization of the metrics is a near certainty.


To exercise command is to articulate an intention to achieve a desired outcome and align a system to behave in such a way that the outcome can be expected to be achieved. To exercise control is to monitor the actual effects resulting from the behavior, assess the information, and report on the system’s performance with respect to the desired outcome. It is then the function of command to decide what to do: to adjust the behavior of the system, take some other action outside the system, or indeed to abandon the original intention and change the desired outcome.


At any point in time, the scorecard is actually unbalanced. In operations, everything matters all the time because we are as strong as our weakest link. In strategy, we are focused, and our focus shifts over time.


Every cause is itself an effect and every effect a cause, linked by feedback loops, some dampening, some reinforcing.


At that point everything depends on people. Metrics give us information. Interpreting the information can impart understanding. Taking the right action requires wisdom. Only people can have that.


“productivity is highest when most of the activity necessary to win is highly routinized, but specialized work is most valuable when there is uncertainty about how to achieve this goal.”

1 We are finite beings with limited knowledge and independent wills. 2 The business environment is unpredictable and uncertain, so we should expect the unexpected and should not plan beyond the circumstances we can foresee. 3 Within the constraints of our limited knowledge we should strive to identify the essentials of a situation and make choices about what it is most important to achieve. 4 To allow people to take effective action, we must make sure they understand what they are to achieve and why. 5 They should then explain what they are going to do as a result, define the implied tasks, and check back with us. 6 They should then assign the tasks they have defined to individuals who are accountable for achieving them, and specify boundaries within which they are free to act. 7 Everyone must have the skills and resources to do what is needed and the space to take independent decisions and actions when the unexpected occurs, as it will. 8 As the situation changes, everyone should be expected to adapt their actions according to their best judgment in order to achieve the intended outcomes. 9 People will only show the level of initiative required if they believe that the organization will support them. 10 What has not been made simple cannot be made clear and what is not clear will not get done.

Directed opportunism is the art of turning activity into thoughtful, purposive action. Doing so does not only help organizations. It also alleviates the misery of the maligned middle manager and lightens the burden of the resented senior executive. It shows respect for individuals and allows them to grow. It enriches people’s lives. That is why I have written this book.
