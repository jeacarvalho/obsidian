Our legacy comprises the spiritual, intellectual, relational, vocational, and social capital we pass on. It’s the sum total of the beliefs you embrace, the values you live by, the love you express, and the service you render to others. It’s the you-shaped stamp you leave when you go.

The reality is that despite the intense social pressure, college isn’t for everyone. In their book Is College Worth It? former United States Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and liberal arts graduate David Wilezol rate the lifetime return on investment for several major colleges and universities. It turns out that high-performing high-school seniors would actually lose potential earning power if they went to certain colleges rather than go straight into the workforce after graduation.

Anticipation is the exact opposite of dread. It means leaning into this experience, embracing it, and playing full out. In life, you often get what you expect. If you expect to get insight, wisdom, and inspiration, you will likely find them. If you expect boredom, confusion, or frustration, you will likely find them as well.

A company that creates and then implements a plan is the exception rather than the rule. We don’t want this to happen when it comes to your Life Plan. We want to ensure you implement it. The only way this is possible is if you have a process in place for making it visible. You need to review, tweak, and revise it regularly if it is to actually shape your life.
