I’d always known the principle: participation in the learning process stimulates learning and encourages growth. Negatively, when the teacher is in total control of the class’s activities, his or her ego may be the only growing thing in the classroom.

Students need to feel that this is “our” class. “Yes, we have a leader, but without our help, this class would not work.”

[[Jesus]] used lecture and [[storytelling]]. People listened as He told simple stories filled with eternal truths.

Am I right to assume that Jesus, were He among us in human form today, would use all the methods available—role-play, lecture, [[storytelling]], drama, questions, and on and on—to bring people closer to Him?

Your vision of what might be in your Sunday school teaching might, with the Holy Spirit’s help, change lives. Start by challenging your assumptions.

Try breaking patterns. Help yourself and your students learn to see differently.

Make a list of your teaching patterns. For example: “I always begin with prayer because it settles my ninth graders down.” “I always take a student out to lunch after Sunday’s class.” “My students almost always find that Bible study is the dullest part of my lesson.” When you’ve finished the list, check those things that you consider excellent patterns that you wouldn’t want to break. For those unchecked things on your list, come up with alternatives.

The more unfamiliar the pattern, the more suspect it is and, because of our bias, the more unlikely that we’ll ever successfully use it. It’s important to approach new ideas realizing that our initial mistrust is normal and healthy, but not necessarily justified.

Good teaching doesn’t just happen, either. Teachers need to put in their time developing spiritual discipline, increasing their knowledge of the age level they teach, and growing in their understanding of the teaching process and the rules governing interpersonal relationships.
