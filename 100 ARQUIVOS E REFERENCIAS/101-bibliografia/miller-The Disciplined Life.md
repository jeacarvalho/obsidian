Christians are to be defined as people who are hungry for God.

Kairos, on the other hand, is time as substance. It is nonsequential and indivisible. Such time is merely is-ness. It is God’s category of time just as chronos is the human category.

God is all present tense. To say he has been or he may be, is to strip all godhood from him and make him a prisoner of mere measured time.
