This passage perfectly illustrates the core premise of this book—namely, that the solution to the disciples’ being swamped by the wind and waves is the exact same solution to our being swamped by our to-do lists and hurried schedules. The solution to our perennial struggle with time management is found in Jesus Christ.

The Hebrew word for “work” here is avodah, which is also translated to mean “worship” in our Bibles.

Our work matters today because it is a means of glorifying God and loving our neighbors as ourselves (see Matthew 22:39). But our work also matters for eternity because God can use it to build his kingdom.

God didn’t need Moses specifically to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, so he finished that work through Joshua. God didn’t need David specifically to build the temple, so he finished that work through Solomon. If I die tomorrow and the Lord wants my work to continue, he will find someone else to do the job or he will simply finish my work when he brings heaven to earth.

In the words of the great preacher Martyn Lloyd-Jones, “A Christian is something before he does anything.”

work—good work—is a means of advancing God’s kingdom and glorifying him. If that’s so, then the gospel of the kingdom should lead us to be incredibly ambitious for our work today. Pastor [[John Piper]] went as far as saying that “aimless, unproductive Christians contradict the creative, purposeful, powerful, merciful God we love.”
