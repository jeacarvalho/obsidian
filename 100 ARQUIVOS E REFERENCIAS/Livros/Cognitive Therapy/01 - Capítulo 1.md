Despite the striking differences among these dominant
schools, they share one basic assumption: The emotionally
disturbed person is victimized by concealed forces over
which he has no control. Emerging from the nineteenth-
century doctrine of physicalism, traditional neuropsychiatry
searches for biological causes such as chemical or
neurological abnormalities, and applies drugs and other
physical measures to relieve the emotional disorder.
Psychoanalysis, whose philosophical underpinnings also
were formed in the nineteenth century, attributes an
individual’s neurosis to unconscious psychological factors:
The unconscious elements are sealed off by psychological
barriers that can only be penetrated by psychoanalytic
interpretations. Behavior therapy, whose philosophical roots
can be traced to the eighteenth century, regards the
emotional disturbance in terms of involuntary reflexes
based on accidental conditionings that occurred previously
in the patient’s life. Since, according to behavioral theory,
the patient cannot modify these conditioned reflexes simply
by knowing about them and trying to will them away, he
requires the application of “counterconditioning” by a
competent behavior therapist.
Because these three leading schools maintain that the
source of the patient’s disturbance lies beyond his
awareness, they gloss over his conscious conceptions, his
specific thoughts and fantasies.
Suppose, however, that these schools are on the wrong
track. Let us conjecture, for the moment, that a person’s
consciousness contains elements that are responsible for
the emotional upsets and blurred thinking that lead him to
seek help. Moreover, let us suppose that the patient has at
his disposal various rational techniques he can use, with
proper instruction, to deal with these disturbing elements in
his consciousness. If these suppositions are correct, then
emotional disorders may be approached from an entirely
different route: Man has the key to understanding and


solving his psychological disturbance within the scope of his
own awareness. He can correct the misconceptions
producing his emotional disturbance with the same
problem-solving apparatus that he has been accustomed to
using at various stages in his development.
These assumptions converge on a relatively new
approach to emotional disorders. Nevertheless, the
philosophical underpinnings of this approach go back
thousands of years, certainly to the time of the Stoics, who
considered man’s conceptions (or misconceptions) of events
rather than the events themselves as the key to his
emotional upsets. This new approach—cognitive therapy—
suggests that the individual’s problems are derived largely
from certain distortions of reality based on erroneous
premises and assumptions. These incorrect conceptions
originated in defective learning during the person’s
cognitive development. Regardless of their origin, it is
relatively simple to state the formula for treatment: The
therapist helps a patient to unrav...
