CHAPTER 2
Tapping the Internal Communications
A personality is a full Congress of orators and
pressure-groups, of children, demagogues,
communists, isolationists, war-mongers, mugwumps,
grafters, log-rollers, lobbyists, Caesars and Christs,
Machiavels and Judases, T
ories and Promethean
revolutionists.—Henry Murray
THE HIDDEN MESSAGE
We are all aware of the various ways that the signs and
signals from our environment dictate what we do and how
we feel. We stop at red lights, detour blasting areas, protest
over mistreatment, exult over praise, and grouse over
reproaches. We are less familiar with the internal
organization of signals that correspond to external signals.
Incoming messages are processed, decoded, and
interpreted by our self-regulating system that issues
instructions and prohibitions, self-praise and self-reproaches.
The complex system of environmental stimuli controls us
only to the extent that it meshes with its internal
psychological counterpart. Our inner workings can shut out


or twist around the signals from the outside so that we may
be completely out of phase with what is going on around us.
A profound or chronic discrepancy between the internal and
the external systems may culminate in psychological
disorders.
Many of the characteristics of the emotional disorders are
puzzling and seem to defy common-sense laws because of
the poverty of relevant information. When the missing data
are supplied, the investigator or therapist can readily apply
his tools to make sense out of the most perplexing
behaviors. Unraveling the meanings woven into an
anomolous reaction is an intriguing enterprise that provides
a wealth of insight into human behavior. Consider these
representative examples from clinical practice:
A woman walking out-of-doors suddenly realized that she
was about three blocks from home and immediately felt
faint.
A professional athlete consistently felt his chest constrict
and his heart pound whenever he was driving his
automobile through a tunnel. He started to gasp for breath
and thought he was dying.
A successful novelist cried bitterly when he was
complimented for his work.
Puzzling reactions such as these have stimulated various
schools of psychotherapy to reach into their conceptual
baggage for explanations. Psychoanalysis, for example, has
explained a woman’s feeling faint when away from home in
terms of unconscious meaning: Being out-of-doors stirs up a
repressed desire such as a wish for seduction or rape
(Fenichel, 1945). The wish arouses anxiety because of its
taboo nature.
Behaviorists, on the other hand, using a conditioning
model of emotions to account for the anxiety, provide a
different kind of explanation. They assume that at some
time in the woman’s life she was confronted with a
realistically dangerous situation, while simultaneously being


exposed to an innocuous situation (such as traveling away
from home). Because of the closeness of the innocuous
stimulus to the real danger, the woman became conditi...
