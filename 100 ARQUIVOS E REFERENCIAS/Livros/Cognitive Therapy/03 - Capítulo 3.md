# Capítulo 3

The thesis that the special meaning of an event
determines the emotional response forms the core of the
cognitive model of emotions and emotional disorders: The
meaning is encased in a cognition—a thought or an image.
Sometimes the cognition may consist simply of a
connotation or value judgment such as “awful” or
“wonderful.” It is a commonplace observation that a
particular emotion may have no connection to the external
circumstances at the time. If we are daydreaming or
ruminating, our emotion is generated by the content of the
reverie or ideas (rather than by an external stimulus).
Finally, if we distort a situation grossly, our emotional
response is consistent with the distortion rather than with
the factual aspects of the situation.
The cognitive model of emotions is derived, initially, from
reports of introspective observations of thoughts and
feelings. Second, the relation of thought to feeling is
determined. Third, generalizations are made regarding what
kinds of thoughts (or meanings) lead to which emotions.
Other theories of emotions have ignored or have not
adequately used people’s reports of their thinking and
feeling. Classical behaviorism uses a stimulus-response
model to explain emotional reactions. It proposes a simpler
route by which an external event leads directly to an
emotional response—without interposing thinking or
meaning between stimulus and response. According to
behavioral theory, the sequence between stimulus and
response has been established as the result of previous
conditioning; hence, this formulation is often referred to as
the conditioning model.
The classical psychoanalytic model of emotions is far
more complex. Reduced to simple terms, the sequence is as
follows: A stimulus or event occurs and arouses an
unconscious wish or impulse. Since the wish is generally
unacceptable to the person, its incipient emergence into
consciousness poses an internal threat. If he is unable to


ward off the taboo impulse through the use of a defense
mechanism, he experiences anxiety or guilt. For example,
according to Freud’s concept of the Oedipus complex, a
young boy reacts to the sight of his mother (the stimulus)
with an unconscious sexual impulse directed toward her. If
the wish threatens to break into consciousness, the boy
feels anxious because of possible punishment from his rival
—the father.1
The behavioral and psychoanalytic models are similar in
that they minimize the importance of meanings that are
accessible to introspective observation and report. The
behaviorists reject meaning totally and the psychoanalysts
emphasize unconscious meanings. The models differ in the
location of the controlling stimulus: According to the
conditioning model, it is external; according to the
psychoanalytic model, it is internal but unconscious (See
Figure 1).
The psychoanalytic and behavioral models skirt the
common conceptions of why a person becomes sad, glad,
afraid, or angry. The cognitive approach, however, brings
the whole matte...
