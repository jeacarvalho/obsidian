he is “going insane,” they are generally associated with
acute neurotic reactions rather than with psychosis.
In addition to experiencing the strange feelings and
disruption of ordinary psychological processes described
above, the patient may be engulfed by intense anxiety,
sadness, or rage. Even when the emotion is a magnification
of a pleasant feeling, such as the euphoria of manic
reactions, its intensity makes it unpleasant.
Is it possible to make sense out of the strange
psychological phenomena in an acute neurosis? A striking
component of the peculiar experiences is intense self-
consciousness. The patient becomes overly aware of his
internal processes. His attention is fixed on his perceptions,
thoughts, and feelings, with the result that these
psychological processes become extremely vivid. In
addition, he is overly attentive to certain cues in his
environment and oblivious to others—“tunnel vision.” With
the binding of his attention to specific internal and external
stimuli, the patient has great difficulty in mobilizing
sufficient attention to focus on other areas of experience.
The phenomenon of self-consciousness and attention-
binding in acute neurosis is similar to reactions experienced
by many people in realistically threatening situations. A
student taking an important oral or written examination
may experience anxiety because of the threat to his life
objectives. He finds it difficult to focus on his immediate
task—reading or listening to the questions and drawing on
his memory to supply the answers. His attention is drawn,
instead, to ideas about failing, continual evaluations of his
performance, and scanning of his unpleasant emotional
state. Because of the fixation of his attention on these
distracting ideas, he has difficulty in making sense out of
the questions, and he experiences “blocking” in his
attempts to recall material and to form the appropriate
sentences. His blocking and impaired efficiency are


produced not by the anxiety per se, but by the binding of his
attention to irrelevant thoughts and feelings.1
A similar set of psychological reactions may ensue upon
exposure to physical danger. A soldier exposed to combat
for the first time may experience difficulties in concentration
and in shifting his focus. His attention may be so fixed on
the notion of danger and the wish to escape that he is
unable to understand and follow commands that will protect
his life. Similar experiences are reported by people in other
precarious situations. A novice, hiking along a steep
mountain slope, may be so preoccupied with the notion of
falling that he walks clumsily or stumbles, thus placing
himself in jeopardy.
Compare the reactions to realistic threats with those
experienced by a patient with an acute anxiety neurosis.
The patient, similarly, is overly alert to stimuli relevant to
danger; any change in his environment, such as an
unexpected sound, draws his attention: He is overly vigilant
to any signal that might be indicative of...
