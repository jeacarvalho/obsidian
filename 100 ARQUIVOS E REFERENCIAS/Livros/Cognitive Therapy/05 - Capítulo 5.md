# Capítulo 5

The term “loser” captures the flavor of the depressive’s
appraisal of himself and his experience. He agonizes over
the notion that he has experienced significant losses, such
as his friends, his health, his prized possessions. He also
regards himself as a “loser” in the colloquial sense: He is a
misfit—an inferior and an inadequate being who is unable to
meet his responsibilities and attain his goals. If he
undertakes a project or seeks some gratification, he expects
to be defeated or disappointed. He finds no respite during
sleep. He has repetitive dreams in which he is a misfit, a
failure.
In considering the concept of loss, we should be sensitive
to the crucial importance of meanings and connotations.
What represents a painful loss for one person may be
regarded as trivial by another. It is important to recognize
that the depressed patient dwells on hypothetical losses and
pseudo losses. When he thinks about a potential loss, he
regards the possibility as though it were an accomplished
fact. A depressed man, for example, characteristically
reacted to his wife’s tardiness in meeting him with the
thought, “She might have died on the way.” He then
construed the hypothetical loss as an actual event and
became forlorn. Pseudo loss refers to the incorrect labeling
of any event as a loss; for example, a change in status that
may in actuality be a gain. A depressed patient who sold
some shares of stock at a large profit experienced a
prolonged sense of deprivation over eliminating the
securities from his portfolio; he ruminated over the notion
that the sale had impoverished him.
Granted that the perception of loss produces feelings of
sadness, how does this sense of loss engender other
symptoms of depression: pessimism, self-criticism, escape-
avoidance-giving up, suicidal wishes, and physiological
disorders?
In order to answer this question, it would be useful to
explore the chronology of depression, the onset and full


development of symptoms. This sequence is most clearly
demonstrated in cases of “reactive depression,” that is,
depression in which there is a clear-cut precipitating factor.
Other cases of depression, in which the onset is more
insidious, show similar (although more subtle) patterns.
DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSION
In the course of his development, the depression-prone
person may become sensitized by certain unfavorable types
of life situations, such as the loss of a parent or chronic
rejection by his peers. Other unfavorable conditions of a less
obvious nature may similarly produce vulnerability to
depression. These traumatic experiences predispose the
person to overreact to analogous conditions later in life. He
has a tendency to make extreme, absolute judgments when
such situations occur. A loss is viewed as irrevocable;
indifference, as total rejection. Other depression-prone
people set rigid, perfectionistic goals for themselves during
childhood, so that their universe collapses when they
confront inevitable disappointments later in ...
