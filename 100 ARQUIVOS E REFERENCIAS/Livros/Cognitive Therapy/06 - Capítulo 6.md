for mobilizing the organism for action in response to danger.
Freud (1915-1917), for instance, wrote: “Realistic anxiety
strikes us as something very rational and intelligible. We
may say of it that it is a reaction to the perception of an
external danger—that is, of an injury which is expected and
foreseen. It is connected with the flight reflex and it may be
regarded as a manifestation of the self-preservative
instinct” (pp. 393-394).
A large body of opinion supports Freud’s notion that
anxiety serves as a signal of danger. Freud (1926) suggests
that anxiety is a warning either of an external or an internal
danger (for example, the impending breakthrough of a
taboo wish). In response to the warning, the individual
prepares for action to cope with the external danger or
mobilizes psychological defenses to protect himself against
the internal danger.
The notion that anxiety is an important stimulus for
preparing an individual physically and psychologically to
combat a threat deserves reconsideration. What evidence
do we have that anxiety is an essential condition for
emergency responses rather than an unpleasant
distraction? How can we be so confident that anxiety
enhances survival? It certainly is possible to think of
instances in which a person can prepare for immediate
action without preliminary priming by anxiety. An athlete
can readily mobilize his resources for a split-second
movement to make a net shot or to catch a runner off base.
The spur of the competitive situation is sufficient—without
the stimulus of anxiety—for the rapid activation of the
central nervous system and a subsequent coordinated
movement of his body. If a person is capable of emergency
responses without anxiety (or anger), why should we expect
that he requires anxiety to mobilize him for appropriate
action in a situation of danger?
We also know, in fact, that anxiety can interfere with the
capacity to deal with danger—and may indeed increase


one’s vulnerability in a life-threatening situation. We are
familiar with instances of “freezing” in the face of a physical
threat. We can readily envision how a trapeze performer or
a bridge worker might have a serious fall as a result of
dizziness and trembling stemming from anxiety. There is
also evidence that prolonged anxiety may produce
physiological disorders in susceptible individuals (see
Chapter 8).
Leventhal (1969) has proposed a “parallel response
paradigm” which outlines the sequence of events from
danger to action: external threat → appraisal of threat →
appropriate coping behavior. Anxiety is experienced after
the appraisal of threat and is concomitant with, not
antecedent to, adaptive behavior; that is, it does not
contribute to the adaptive sequence. When anxiety
encroaches on coping behavior, it is likely to have a
disruptive effect. Perhaps the time has come for those who
attribute a useful function to anxiety to generate more
powerful arguments to buttress their position.
The notion of purposiveness to anxiety a...
