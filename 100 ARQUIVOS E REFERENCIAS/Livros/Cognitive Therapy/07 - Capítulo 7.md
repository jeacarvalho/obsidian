“which becomes attached to objects or situations which
objectively are not a source of danger—or, more precisely,
are known by the individual not to be a source of danger [p.
293].” These assertions make the phobias sound more
mysterious than they actually are, raising such questions as:
Is it correct to assert that there is no source of danger in the
phobic situation? When the patient is actually in the phobic
situation, is he really convinced there is no hazard?
When we examine the content of the phobia, we find that
the fear is rarely bizarre or irrational. Consider patients who
have phobias of going into water over their heads, eating in
strange restaurants, crossing bridges, traveling through
tunnels, or riding in elevators. Can it be denied that there is
some risk in each of these situations? We know that people
do drown and that they die from contaminated food or
water. Bridges do collapse, tunnels cave in, and elevators
get stuck. The label phobia is warranted only when the
person greatly exaggerates the probability of harm and
experiences distress disproportionate to the real risk.
Similarly, speaking in public or taking examinations
involve risks of psychological injury. It is a fact of life that
other people can be cruel and torment one of their fellows
who “makes a fool of himself” in public speaking. An
examination involves the risk of failure and consequent
disapproval, humiliation, anguish. Thus, the phobias that
relate to situations where psychosocial harm can occur also
contain an element of realistic risk.
When we examine some of the more common phobias
we see that many of them incorporate fears that are
prevalent among children at various stages of their
development. In reviewing the development of phobias, we
shall see that many are derived from fears commonly
experienced in childhood. Most children learn to cope with
the possible danger and thus “outgrow” the fear.
We still have to account for certain types of phobias that
obviously do not involve any element of danger to the


patient; for example, violent anxiety at the sight of another
person injured, bleeding, or undergoing a surgery. These
phobias become evident among hospital professionals, such
as physicians and nurses, who are forced by circumstances
into such situations and cannot use familiar techniques of
avoidance. They experience typical symptoms of anxiety as
described previously and, although most seem to become
hardened in the course of time, there are some who retain
the phobia despite repeated exposures.
The answer to the puzzle is found in the observation that
such phobics have a high degree of identification with the
“victim.” The mechanism of identification becomes evident
upon questioning: The person is able to recall either visual
or sensory imaging or some kind of cognition that indicates
he is reacting to the event as though he were the victim. A
medical student watching an operation had a visual image
of himself on the operating table (see Chapter 3)...
