of psychosomatic disorders and hysteria that an “interaction
model” is most useful for understanding these conditions.
This model is more adequate than other solutions to the
mind-body problem in explaining the clinical observation. In
the case examples, only the interaction model can
encompass and organize meaningful relations among the
data such as emotional arousal, observable physical lesion,
improvement of lesion following psychological treatment,
and relief of emotional stress by sedative drugs.
Clinicians have described a number of disorders in which
psychological factors play an important role in the
production of physical disfunction or distress. Sometimes
these psychological factors are defined in terms of some
event or circumstance that constitutes a stress. The physical
disorders which have been closely linked to emotional
disturbances may be divided into three groups: (1)
Physiological disturbances or structural abnormalities in
which psychological and constitutional factors combine to
produce the disorder. These psychosomatic disorders1
include conditions such as duodenal ulcer, pylorospasm and
colitis, and some specific forms of disorders in the groups of
dermatitis, hypertension, paroxysmal increases in the heart
rate, and headaches. These conditions generally are
triggered or aggravated by states of emotional arousal. (2)
Primary physical disorders that are exacerbated by
psychological processes. This category includes cases of
“psychological overlay,” such as cardiac invalidism and
severe dyspnea based on mild chest pathology. (3)
Aberration of sensation or movement, but with no
demonstrable tissue pathology or disturbed physiology. This
category includes a broad spectrum of conditions ranging
from “somatic imaging” and the hysterias to somatic
delusions. In many respects, this group is the most
intriguing of the entire category of somatic symptoms
related to psychological factors.


PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS
Psychosomatic disorders are defined in terms of
demonstrable abnormalities in the function or structure of
an organ or physiological system of the body: skin,
gastrointestinal system, genitourinary system,
cardiovascular system, or respiratory system. These
systems contain smooth muscles, not under voluntary
control, innervated by the autonomic nervous system.
However, the musculoskeletal system composed of striated
muscles under voluntary control may also be the site of
psychophysiological disorders such as headache and
backache (American Psychiatric Association, 1968).
During the past 50 years, a number of different
interaction models have been proposed to clarify the
relation between psychological and physiological factors in
the production of psychosomatic disorders. These models
have been critically reviewed elsewhere (Mendelson, Hirsch,
and Webber, 1956; Beck, 1972a).
The models, in general, are of two types. First,
psychological specificity models: The kind of psychosomatic
disorder depends on a specific personality pr...
