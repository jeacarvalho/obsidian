it often is blended with myths, superstitions, and
misconceptions that aggravate an unrealistic orientation.
Moreover, many people are not motivated to engage in a
“self-improvement” program unless it is instigated in a
professional setting.
In any event, psychotherapy can have the greatest
impact on problems because of the considerable authority
attributed to the therapist, his ability to pinpoint the
problems, and his skill in providing an appropriate
systematic set of procedures.
TARGETS OF COGNITIVE THERAPY
Cognitive techniques are most appropriate for people
who have the capacity for introspection and for reflecting
about their own thoughts and fantasies. This approach is
essentially an extension and a refinement of what people
have done to varying degrees since the early stages of their
intellectual development. The particular techniques such as
labeling objects and situations, setting up hypotheses, and
weeding out and testing the hypotheses are based on skills
that people apply automatically without being cognizant of
the operations involved.
This kind of intellectual function is analogous to the
formation of speech in which rules of pronunciation and
grammatical construction are applied without consciousness
of the rules or of their application. When an adult has to
correct a speech disorder or attempts to learn a new
language, then he has to concentrate on the formation of
words and sentences. Similarly, when he has a problem in
interpreting certain aspects of reality, it may be useful for
him to focus on the rules he applies in making judgments. In
examining a problem area, he finds that the rule is incorrect
or that he has been applying it incorrectly.


Since making the incorrect judgments has probably
become a deeply ingrained habit, which he may not be
conscious of, several steps are required to correct it. First,
he has to become aware of what he is thinking. Second, he
needs to recognize what thoughts are awry. Then he has to
substitute accurate for inaccurate judgments. Finally, he
needs feedback to inform him whether his changes are
correct. The same kind of sequence is necessary for making
behavioral changes, such as improving form in a sport,
correcting faults in playing an instrument, or perfecting
techniques of persuasion.
T
o illustrate the process of cognitive change, let us take
as a rather gross example a person who is afraid of all
strangers. When we explore his reactions, we may find that
he is operating under the rule, “All strangers are unfriendly
or hostile.” In this case, the rule is wrong. On the other
hand, he may realize that strangers vary, but he may not
have learned to discriminate among friendly strangers,
neutral strangers, and unfriendly strangers. In such a case,
his trouble is in applying the rule, that is, in converting the
available information in a given situation into an appropriate
judgment.
It is obvious that not all people who think erroneously
need or want to get their thinking straightened out....
