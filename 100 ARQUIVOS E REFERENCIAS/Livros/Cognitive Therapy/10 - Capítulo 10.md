# Capítulo 10

cancelled because of rain. An anxious woman sees a burned
building and thinks that her house may be on fire. A
paranoid patient sees a frown on the face of a passerby and
concludes that person wants to harm him. The technique of
prying the patient loose from his pattern of regarding
himself as the focal point of all events is called decentering.
The successful application of this method is illustrated in the
following case (Schuyler, 1973).
A graduate student had a good deal of anxiety prior to
taking examinations. His anxiety was exacerbated because
he interpreted the physiological symptoms (shortness of
breath, tachycardia, etc.) as signs of an impending heart
attack. According to his philosophy of predestination, he
decided that fate had singled him out for a special hardship.
He passed the written examination for an advanced degree
but failed the oral examination. Although he realized that
his anxiety had interfered with his oral examination, he
interpreted the failure itself as evidence that fate was
against him.
At the time he was to take his oral examination a second
time, there was considerable snow on the ground. On the
way to the examination, he slipped and fell. He then
became quite anxious. He was able to identify the relevant
thought: “The snow has been put there so that I would fall.”
Then he recalled what his therapist had told him about his
tendency to personalize external events. He looked around
and saw that other people were slipping, that automobiles
were skidding on the ice, and that even a dog had slid and
fallen. As he was struck by the realization that the snow was
not a special hardship directed at him, his anxiety
disappeared.
AUTHENTICATING CONCLUSIONS


It generally does not occur to a person to question the
validity of his thoughts. He tends to regard ideas as though
they were a microcosm of the outside world. He attaches
the same truth value to his thought as he does to his
perception of the external world.
Even after a patient is able to make a clear distinction
between his internal mental processes and the outside
world that stimulates them, it is still necessary to educate
him regarding the procedures for acquiring accurate
knowledge. People continually set up hypotheses and draw
inferences. They tend to equate an inference with reality
and to accept a hypothesis as though it were a fact. Under
ordinary circumstances, they might be able to function
adequately because their ideation may be sufficiently in
phase with the real world so as not to substantially interfere
with their adjustment.
In cases of neurosis, the distorted concepts can have a
disabling effect. These distorted concepts lead to faulty
thinking in certain circumscribed areas of experience. In
these particular sectors they tend to make global
undifferentiated judgments instead of the fine
discriminations that are necessary to keep in tune with
reality. As indicated in Chapter 4, the patient frequently
detours logic and leaps to arbitrary inferences,
