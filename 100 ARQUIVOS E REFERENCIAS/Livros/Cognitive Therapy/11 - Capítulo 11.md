well within the patient’s capability. Working together,
therapist and patient design more activities along a
complexity and duration gradient. For example, a depressed
housewife initially might be encouraged simply to boil an
egg. With each successive mastered experience, she can
build up to preparing an entire meal.
Mastery and Pleasure Therapy [M & P Therapy]. The
essence of this kind of therapy is to have the patient keep a
running account of his activities and to mark down “M” for
each mastery experience and “P” for each pleasure
experience. The purpose of this procedure is to penetrate
the “blindness” of depressed patients to situations in which
they are successful and their readiness to forget situations
that do bring them some satisfaction.
Cognitive Reappraisal. As noted previously, cognitive
therapy utilizes a number of techniques whose major mode
of action is the modification of faulty patterns of thinking.
This technique consists essentially of identifying the typical
maladaptive cognitions and attitudes. This ideation is then
evaluated by patient and therapist to test its validity. There
are at least seven steps: (1) identification of sequence
between depressive cognitions and sadness; (2)
identification of sequence between cognitions and
motivations (avoidance wishes and suicidal impulses); (3)
exploration of depressive cognitions; (4) examination,
evaluation, and modification of these cognitions; (5)
identification of overgeneralization, arbitrary inference,
dichotomous thinking; (6) identification of underlying
assumptions; (7) examination, evaluation and modification
of basic premises and assumptions.
Alternative Therapy. This method consists of two different
approaches: (1) Considering alternative explanations for
experiences. The depressed patient shows a systematic
negative bias in his interpretations. By thinking of other
explanations, he is enabled to recognize his bias and to
substitute more accurate interpretations. (2) Considering


alternative ways of dealing with psychological and
situational problems. By discussing different ways of dealing
with his problems, the patient finds solutions to problems
that he considered insoluble. He also realizes that options
he has already discarded may be viable and can lead him
out of his dilemma.
Cognitive Rehearsal. This technique is used to expose the
problems that deter a patient from carrying out goal-
directed activities. By imagining himself going through the
steps involved in the specified activity, the patient is able to
report the specific “obstacles” he anticipates and the
conflicts that are aroused. These blocks to action can then
be the focus of discussion.
Homework Assignments. It is apparent from the
foregoing that the cognitive therapy of depression requires
a substantial amount of work outside of the therapy hour.
Homework assignments are made at each session. The
patient is generally expected to carry out certain activities
that will counteract his depressive symptoms...
