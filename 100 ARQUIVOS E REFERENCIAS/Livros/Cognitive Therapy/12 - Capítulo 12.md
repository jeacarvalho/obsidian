# Capítulo 12

When the problem is visualized from the perspective of the
future, it often shrinks to appropriate proportions.
Although induced fantasy techniques are not applicable
to every case of depression, they are often helpful. In some
cases, the repeated imaging of a traumatic event may
alleviate the associated distress. In other cases,
expectations of future disaster may be reduced to realistic
proportions by repeated visualization of the anticipated
event (Beck, 1967).
EXAGGERATION OF EXTERNAL DEMANDS
Many depressed patients have a sense of being
overwhelmed by the everyday problems of living. Certain
responsibilities that were regarded as interesting challenges
during the nondepressed period now seem to be impossible
burdens. Some patients may feel so crushed by these
“overwhelming burdens” that they think of suicide as the
only way to escape. When the problems are discussed,
however, it becomes apparent that the patient has greatly
exaggerated their magnitude and importance. Through
rational exploration, the patient may regain his perspective
and then set about defining what has to be done and how to
go about doing it. The therapist generally has to take the
lead in helping the patient to list his responsibilities, set
priorities, and formulate the appropriate course of action.
Since the implementation of the plan may be blocked by
self-defeating thoughts, the therapist should use the kind of
cognitive rehearsal described previously in order to elicit
these negative thoughts. For instance, a depressed
housewife felt paralyzed at the thought of marketing. After
compiling a shopping list with the patient, the therapist
suggested that she fantasize going to the supermarket. In
her fantasy, she was stymied by indecision each time she
attempted to select an item. It was discovered that the


indecisiveness resulted from a stream of thoughts that she
would make the wrong decision. When these self-doubts
were dealt with in the therapy hour, she was able to have a
fantasy of successfully making each purchase on her
shopping list. She felt much more optimistic and, indeed,
succeeded in doing her marketing in reality.2
OUTCOME STUDIES OF COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY
Three patients with chronic and relapsing depression
were treated with a combination of cognitive and behavioral
techniques. The main behavioral modality consisted of the
use of activity schedules. The cognitive approach was
directed at exposing and correcting the patients’ negative
distortions of the activities undertaken. These patients,
although not substantially helped by drug therapy, showed
prompt and sustained improvement with cognitive-
behavioral therapy as reflected by their scores on the
Hamilton and Beck depression measures (Rush, Khatami,
and Beck, 1975).
Recent innovations in the behavior therapy of depression
also consist primarily of highly structured and directive
techniques (see Beck and Greenberg, 1974, for a review of
the literature on cognitive and behavioral techniques). ...
