Another technique used by behavior therapists is
“assertive training.” In essence this technique consists of
coaching the patient to be more assertive in interpersonal
situations that inhibit or frighten him. The training is similar
to the time-honored technique of role playing. The therapist
assumes the role of a typical person or class of persons (for
example, members of the opposite sex, authority figures,
sales clerks) and the patient practices various interpersonal
techniques in which he assumes a dominant or active role
rather than a submissive or passive role. Ultimately, the
patient practices this new role in real life situations. The
behavior therapist conceptualizes the improvement
resulting from assertive training as a “counterconditioning”
process: The assertive response neutralizes the anxiety
(conditioned response) aroused by the threatening person
(stimulus); the bond between the stimulus and conditioned
anxiety is dissolved.
The cognitive interpretation of the therapeutic action is
quite different: The patient has an unreasonable fear of a
specific person or class of persons (clerks, etc.). As he
practices asserting himself with the therapist, he
automatically tests the validity of the fear. He begins to
sense that he has exaggerated the power and awesomeness
he attributed to the other person. Not only does his concept
of the other person change, but his concept of himself
changes: He begins to view himself in a more positive way.
He no longer believes that he is weak, vulnerable, and
unable to cope with the other person but, instead, begins to
conceive of himself as capable, competent—and safe. He
has acquired “self-confidence.”
A similar process of change of concept of the self and
others occurs in the behavioral technique of “modeling”


(Bandura, 1969). In this method, the patient patterns
himself after another person who deals effectively with
people or situations that frighten the patient. As he
practices the techniques used by the model, he gradually
modifies his self-concept as in assertive training.
In recent years, behavioral approaches to depression
have been proposed (Lewinsohn, 1974a; Jackson, 1972;
Gathercole, 1972). These methods all have in common the
element of inducing the patient to become more active. The
rationale for the procedure is as follows. The behavioral
formulation defines depression in terms of a deficit model;
there is a diminution of normal work-oriented or pleasure-
seeking behaviors. These “desirable” behaviors are
increased in frequency by positively reinforcing the patient
for engaging in them. After sufficient episodes of positive
reinforcement, the frequency of the desirable behaviors is
increased until they return to the normal level. At that point,
the patient—by definition—is n...
