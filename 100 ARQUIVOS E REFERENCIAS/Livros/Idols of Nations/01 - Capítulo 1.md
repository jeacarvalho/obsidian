Introduction
The present study investigates the interaction between theology and economy in the
writings of four political economists—Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Adam Smith and
Thomas Malthus—who are commonly grouped with the founding “fathers” of
“economics.” If, as Ben Fine and Dimitri Milonakis argue,[1] the discipline of economics
constituted itself through a process of individualization, de-socialization, and de-
historicization, we would like to add to this the process of de-theologization, as also an
important step in the dialectic of reduction and universalism that is crucial to economics
imperialism. For Fine and Milonakis, “economics imperialism” refers to the application of
supposed universal criteria derived from classical and neoclassical economics to all
aspects of human existence, including the choices people make in relation to religion.
That is, religion too is a marketplace, and human beings as economic animals make
rational choices in light of what they regard as their own benefit. In the process of
reduction and universalization, the specific and limited nature of the economic theory in
question is effaced. These limitations appear when one investigates not only the social
and historical context of its emergence, but also the biblical and theological nature of
those earlier debates. Our task here is to focus on this final element, namely, the way the
Bible and theology indelibly stamp the theories in question.
W
e have decided to focus on four of the key theorists rather than offer a grand sweep
characteristic of what is known as the “History of Economic Thought” (HET).[2] These
histories inevitably either lead up to Adam Smith, or begin with his work and then
follow his successors, thereby marking him as both the culmination of a preparatory
phase and the inaugurator of a new tradition. W
e opt to place Smith within this
continuum rather than designate him as a beginning or end of a particular tradition. But
why do we focus on these four? It enables us to dig deeper into their work, to explore the
crucial deployments and rewritings of the myth of the emergence of private property,
labor, if not the free market itself. Thereby, we are able to investigate with some patience
their engagements with the Bible and the myths they derive from it, especially how they
struggle to force new theories of economic activity and human nature from biblical
narratives that resist such theories.[3]


Thus, in the chapter on Grotius (1583–1645), we identify his Arminian (or
Remonstrant) theology and the constituent role it plays in his interpretation of the Fall.
Keen to avoid the imputation of evil to God and to assert the freedom of the will for each
individual, Grotius effectively minimizes the effects of the Fall on human nature. As a
ruling class ideologue in the United Provinces (Netherlands) during the first capitalist
commercial empire, he shares their abhorrence at the central doctrinal point of Calvinism
that all one’s works, achievements, wealth, and power count as nothing before God. This
effort to tame the Fall provides the necessary preconditions for what is arguably the first
version of the myth of capitalism—a myth that constructs a story of the origin of private
property out of an original common, as well as the growth of law
, states, and commerce.
That myth also provides Grotius with a means for arguing that the seas cannot be
private property, for they have never met the criteria he has invented. Grotius also
provides an excellent example of the constitutive limitations of the doctrine of liberalism,
particularly in the way he shows how slavery is entailed by private property.
From Grotius we move to Locke (1632–1704), who develops the myth further on the
basis of his own effort to limit the effects of the Fall. For Locke, the Fall pertains only to
mortality, which enables him to sidestep the other curses relating to labor and property.
However, the Fall continues to trip up Locke as he outlays both his principles of human
nature (freedom and equality) and his myth. In order to trace the Fall’s deft ability to
trouble Locke’s efforts, we focus on both of his treatises on government, since the first
treatise’s detailed biblical engagements (especially Genesis 1–3) provide the basis for his
famous myth of property in the fifth book of the second treatise. Like Grotius, Locke
provides clear examples of the logic of exclusion found in the universal claims of
liberalism, particularly in terms of children, the state of nature, and ethnocentrism.
Grotius and Locke may have provided early versions of the myth of capitalism, but
Adam Smith (1723–90) is really the preeminent mythmaker and storyteller. Not content
with a single myth, he develops two: a foundation myth and a grand narrative. While the
former seeks to justify his assertions concerning human nature (that human beings
naturally truck, barter, and exchange, and that self-interest leads to greater social benefit),
the latter universalizes the chronic particularity of Smith’s ideas concerning capitalism
and the free market. Beyond those myths, we also explore his penchant for vignettes,
fables, sayings, moral tales, and parables. But does the Fall make its presence felt in
Smith’s writings? At first glance, he seems to have left it behind; yet at a deeper, narrative
level it recurs—not merely in the construction of myths but also in the tension between
narratives of difference and those of identity, between those stories that need to narrate a


passage from a different state in the past to those that assert that the past was largely the
same as the present. W
e close by observing that Smith’s ambivalence concerning religion
enables both theological and secular readings of his rambling works.
W
e close our in-depth analyses with Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), not least because
he troubles any clear narrative of the secularization of economic thought after Smith.
Malthus is one of the few with a decidedly strong doctrine of evil. Obviously, this means
that the Fall is once again crucially important, especially when one studies Malthus’s
sermons (he was a priest in the Church of England). With this in mind, we analyze
closely his essay on population, especially the first edition with its stark observations
concerning the goodness of God that turns into evil. For Malthus, God’s gifts of
procreation and the impulse to work for our subsistence lead inevitably to misery and
vice through overpopulation and inadequate food. That Malthus shies away from the full
implications of his argument is made clear through the subsequent editions of his essay
on population, where he asserts the role of moral sanction on restricting the drive for sex.
His backpedaling only serves to highlight the possibility that God may be responsible
for both good and evil. All of these issues appear in his half dozen efforts to retell the
myth of capitalism. Although Malthus dabbles with a myth of progress, he clearly prefers
a myth of regress, with its increasingly dire outcomes that result from the growth of
human societies and economies. Yet Malthus’s chronic racism—which he shares with
Adam Smith and indeed John Locke—is once again the clearest indication that
liberalism’s universal claims are far from universal.
Thus, the central themes that appear in the following study include the importance of
the biblical Fall (to the extent that the early economic theories of capitalism were wrested
from the text of Genesis 1–3), the importance of myth,[4] the theorists’ near-obsessive
deliberations concerning human nature, and the systemic limitations of liberalism and its
claims to freedom. However, given that a number of recent studies deal with matters
concerning religion and economics, we would like to point out what this work is not.
First of all, we do not undertake a study of economic theology, by which we mean
the spate of studies that emphasize moral and social justice issues. For the most part,
these studies are written by theologians of a mildly left-wing persuasion seeking to
critique capitalism and its ravages. While we are in some sympathy with the general
tenor of such works, we remain suspicious of ethics as an elite discourse.[5] That is, given
the very way ethics first appears in the oft-cited work of Aristotle, especially The
Nicomachian Ethics, it continues to be determined by the ruling class assumptions in
which he framed his treatment.[6] Second, we are not engaged in adding to the arsenal of


neoclassical economic theory, using religion as a way to understand the psychological
and motivational factors that the traditional homo economicus fails to answer.[7] Third, we
find the efforts by those who are inspired by a radically conservative agenda (often
known as radical orthodoxy) to be quite wayward. This emphasis may appear in a weak
form, making the unremarkable point that economic theory is based upon unexamined
moral and ideological assumptions or that economics and religion may be loosely
analogous.[8] It may also appear in a distinctly reactionary form, arguing that “revealed
religion” is the basis of economics.[9] Finally, we are clearly opposed to any form of
economics imperialism, which approaches the study of religious belief, behavior, and
institutions from an economic, market, or “rational choice” perspective.[10]
One question remains: why “Idols of Nations” as our title? Since Adam Smith most
likely drew the title of W
ealth of Nations from Isa. 61:6,12 (and 60:5), we consider it
apropos to draw upon the Bible for a title that presents an opposing view
. Thus, we
found that the psalms and prophetic texts also speak of the idols of nations. Jeremiah
14:22 asks, “Can any idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers?”
But Ps. 135:15 comes straight to the point: “The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
the work of human hands.” In other words, the development of classical economics
identifies not so much the sources of the wealth of nations but rather provides—
unwittingly—a theory that seeks to justify the idolatry of the nations which worship the
work of human hands.

2. One of the most sweeping of such efforts is that of Viner, or rather the snippets that appeared of a project he
was never able to complete. He runs all the way from classical Greece to the 1960s, thereby replicating the
myth of classicism and the grand narratives characteristic of economic theorists such as Smith. The effect is
both to universalize the specific forms of economic behavior peculiar to capitalism and to exclude or sideline
significant contributions, including Marxists and Calvinists. Jacob Viner, The Role of Providence in the Social
Order: An Essay in Intellectual History  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1972); Jacob Viner, Essays on
the Intellectual History of Economics  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991).
3. Others may have made the list, such as John Stuart Mill, but his self-proclaimed “Religion of Humanity” in
its hand-wringing liberal form offers little in the way of intense struggle, by which we mean the effort to
wrest a new story of human nature and economic activity from the traditions he inherited. To be sure, his
thoughts on communism and the stable state of society are perhaps the best parts of his work, but they fall
short of a serious engagement with communism. Hobbes might also have been worthwhile to discuss,
especially since he argues that human beings left to their own devices do not obey the laws of nature.
Rather, they are given to the desires for safety, gain, glory, and power, thereby engaging in continual warfare


with one another. For that reason, they need a strong, authoritarian government to keep them in line. In the
state of nature, man’s life was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” and was engaged in a “war . . . of every
man against every man.” The government may be democratic to a limited extent, but Hobbes preferred
absolute monarchy. He focuses on human nature and government, with little in the way of economic
thought. Already in the 1950s, Levy was able to summarize Hobbes’s economic thought in a few pages.
