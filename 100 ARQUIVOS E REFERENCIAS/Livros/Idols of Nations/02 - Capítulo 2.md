Hugo Grotius: Rewriting the Narrative of the Fall
The authority of those books which men inspired by God, either writ or approved of, I often use. [1]
 
Ruling class lawyer, Renaissance man, intimate of the Dutch East India Company
(VOC), prison escapee, exile from his Dutch homeland, Swedish ambassador, and
articulate advocate of liberal theology (with its focus on free will of the individual), Hugo
de Groot (Latinized as Grotius) was an early ideologue of the hard-headed capitalism of
the Dutch commercial empire.[2] Above all, we are interested in the way Grotius
inaugurates a tradition in which the biblical account of the Fall is reread and rewritten in
order to justify the increasingly clear contours of capitalism. In the process of his
revision, Grotius constructs an alternative myth, one that John Locke, Thomas Malthus,
and Adam Smith in turn reshaped for largely the same reason. Why the Fall? Grotius,
and those who came after him, believed the Fall held the key to understanding human
nature. Since God had created human beings, it would be remiss not to consider the
nature of those first creatures, Adam and (occasionally) Eve. For these reasons, human
nature, the Fall, a new myth, and the newly emerging reality of capitalism are the four
nodal points of our analysis. The following discussion begins with the questions of
human nature and the Fall through the lens of Grotius’s Arminian theology, a theology
that would also influence the thought of Locke. In light of that theology, Grotius reads
the Fall as less of a catastrophe. Through the work of the Holy Spirit (prevenient grace),
human beings become free-willing agents able to choose between good and evil, even to
accept or resist God’s call of grace. This analysis leads to our main concern—Grotius’s
effort to construct an alternative myth that bounces off and reshapes the Fall narrative in
order to provide an account of the origins of private property, law
, commerce, the state,


and those zones (such as the sea) that fall outside the claims of such property. From here,
we deal with a couple of implications of this myth: an early articulation of the free
individual with rights (plural) as private property; the contradictions inherent in the
liberalism that Grotius sets under way, particularly in terms of the universal of exclusion
whereby freedom for “all” restricts what counts as “all.” W
e close by dealing with the
question of class, for both the Arminian theology and the economic and ideological
doctrines advocated by Grotius served the interests of the ruling class (of which he was a
member in the United Provinces). Class will also emerge as a consistent feature of the
economic thought we analyze in the following chapters, since the thinkers examined
speak on behalf of ruling class consciousness.
Before proceeding, let us comment regarding our focus on Grotius’s economic
thought. Though well known for reshaping the long and rich tradition of natural law
, he
also wrote on areas of politics, ethics, and theology. Indeed, Grotius wrote during a time
when these subjects were seen as a larger whole rather than being divided into discrete
disciplines. Consequently, an emphasis on economic theory requires a process of
distillation, a careful sifting for clarity. As anyone who has distilled alcoholic spirits
knows, such distillation is never complete, so from time to time we include items from
Grotius’s wider interests.
Softening the Fall
The power of chusing moral good or evil, with which he is endued.[3]
W
e begin with the cluster of problems surrounding the Fall—when the first human
beings disobeyed God and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
in the garden. Not only is the Fall central for the economic theorists we discuss later, but
it also feeds into Grotius’s myth of the emergence of private property and thereby the
doctrine of the free seas. As a result, it gives rise to the free-willing individual who reveals
the paradoxes of liberalism. These lines of thought emerge from theological, if not
biblical, engagement. More precisely, Grotius arrives at an early form of the grand myth
of capitalism as well as a statement concerning the private, free individual by means of
theological argumentation.
In order to set the scene, we need to offer a brief exposition of the theological
framework to which Grotius gave his assent and without which his work cannot be
understood.[4] The “Remonstrants” (or Arminians) followed the thought of Jacobus
Arminius (Harmenzoon), who sought to oppose Calvin’s doctrine of election and


double predestination.[5] Arminius argued that through the Fall, human beings are
depraved and corrupted. So also did Calvin, but now Arminius veers away from Calvin,
specifically through his theory of prevenient grace—the groundwork of the Holy Spirit,
which removes the guilt of the first sin. To be sure, Calvin sometimes equivocates,
suggesting on the one hand that the Fall effaces our status as beings created in the image
of God, thereby rendering us entirely depraved; on the other hand, he leaves open the
possibility that the image of God is not entirely lost with the Fall. Here, Arminius saw a
small crack, through which he was able to slip a new set of doctrines. His understanding
of prevenient grace goes much further than Calvin’s, for in removing the guilt of the sin
of Adam and Eve, it makes a person capable of responding to the call of salvation. Even
so, Arminius is careful to say that this capability is not inherent to human beings, but
rather a gift of God’s grace:
Though we always and on all occasions make this grace to precede, to accompany and follow; and without
which, we constantly assert, no good action whatever can be produced by man. Nay, we carry this principle
so far as not to dare to attribute the power here described [free will] even to the nature of Adam himself,
without the help of Divine Grace both infused and assisting.[6]
Yet, the implications are momentous, for prevenient grace opens up a wide arena for free
will. That is, the Holy Spirit comprehensively covers all bases; its preparatory work
affects all people and the entire person, the outcome being that everyone possesses free
will, a power that God grants to human beings (thereby limiting God’s own power).[7] It
should not be difficult to see what this means for salvation. God’s grace is no longer
irresistible but resistible; human beings exercise their free will by either accepting grace
or resisting it. A similar pattern of moving from the universal to the particular operates in
Arminius’s Christology. Although Christ dies for all in a potentially universal atonement
for every human being, his atonement is effective only for those who accept the call of
God to salvation. Even more, the exercise of free will means that one may at some time
accept that call of grace and then at another reject it. The loss of one’s faith removes him
from the elect—salvation may well be lost.
W
e have traveled far from Calvin’s doctrine of predestination according to which one
is always numbered with either the elect or the damned. This should not come as a
surprise, since Arminius set out to undermine precisely that doctrine: through prevenient
grace and free will, human beings cooperate with God in the process of salvation. What
happens to the central doctrine of election? It becomes conditional, dependent upon
human response. Yet, Arminius gives election an intriguing twist. Although salvation
involves the human response to God’s election, God foreordained who would possess


such faith. In other words, God knows beforehand who will believe, who will exercise
free will and choose to accept God’s election. As Arminius puts it: “the decree of God by
which, of Himself, from eternity, He decreed to justify in Christ, believers, and to accept
them unto eternal life, to the praise of His glorious grace.”[8] This twist may seem to
bring Arminius back to Calvin, for if God knows beforehand who will have faith, does
that not really mean that God predestines who will be saved? Not quite, for God operates
within the limits of foreknowledge: as omniscient, God may be able to peer ahead, as it
were, and determine who is going to respond favorably; God may even limit election to
those who will answer the call. But this is a far cry from predestining those who, before
the creation of the world, are of the damned and of the saved.
Arminius was, therefore, a true theological liberal before liberalism became
fashionable. However, we would like to focus on the questions of evil and the Fall, for
these lead us directly to Grotius. Arminius found Calvin’s predestination unacceptable,
for he saw it attributing evil to God. If God arbitrarily saves some and condemns others
to hell, then God becomes a monster and a tyrant. Even more, if God predestines people
before the Fall, they have no free will, and their evil acts can have only one source—God.
For Arminius, and Grotius following him, the source of evil is instead free will.
Concerning this matter, the Bible offers three possibilities. The first is an evil being who,
in opposition to a God who is entirely good, is the source of evil. The New Testament
references to the Evil One and Satan, which are then read back into the serpent of Genesis
3 or the “satan” (adversary) of Job (see also 1 Chron. 21:1 and Zech. 3:1-2), are the
obvious biblical sources. The unresolved theological issue concerns the source of such a
figure, a problem that led to the apocryphal myth of Satan as a fallen angel. The second
option positions human free will as the source of evil. Free will in itself may be good, a
gift from God to human beings so that they may worship him of their own volition
rather than as automatons, but it leaves room for choosing the wrong course. Genesis 3
once again does service in this option as well, for the human beings are commanded not
to eat of the fruit of the tree of good and evil, but they disobey. Yet, a problem emerges
here, too, for God is the one responsible for the flawed crystal; he placed the tree in the
garden. So a third possibility appears, namely, that God is responsible for both good and
evil. Though this represents a strictly monotheistic position, many have found it
objectionable on moral grounds. Nonetheless, the Bible is little concerned for that
aristocratic discipline known as ethics,[9] presenting God as one who visits evil upon
people. In many cases, one may argue that such evil is really punishment, but in other
cases it is clearly not so. The story of Job comes to mind, as does Ezek. 20:25, in which


God gives the people laws that are evil: “Moreover I gave them statutes that were not
good and ordinances by which they could not live.” This appears to be a reference to
child sacrifice (mentioned in the following verse), which would thereby be a divine statute
that led the people to disobey other laws forbidding such sacrifice.
Of these three options, Grotius (following Arminius) favors the second concerning
free will, while expressing abhorrence at the possibility that God may be the source of
evil. Yet, if God is the creator, how does one account for the presence of evil? Grotius
answers that God is the author of “all such things as have a real existence,”[10] which may
include accidents, loss, pain, and punishment.[11] Yet, evil itself does not have a real
existence; it is a negative, an absence of good, or (as Grotius puts it) a “defect.”[12] This
means that an evil force or principle does not exist in and of itself. Why not? Because
being is inherently good, an evil being is an oxymoron; in this way, Grotius counters the
first position mentioned earlier, namely, that a being opposed to God is the source of evil.
His argument is not new
, and its weakness is easily discerned. By arguing that evil is
merely a negative or a defect, Grotius severely hobbles himself when it comes to dealing
with the presence of evil. For instance, the CEO responsible for serious environmental
destruction, through pursuit of dangerous industrial activities, can hardly be said to be
guilty of an action with no real existence. The dead fish, birds, and ailing human beings
are rather tangible presence of such evil. Or take exploited workers, whose long hours
and low pay enable the boss’s profits: W
e would hazard a guess that they would probably
object somewhat strenuously if we were to suggest that their onerous conditions are
merely a negative, an absence rather than a lived and daily reality.
To counter such arguments—that the world is overcome with a virtual deluge of
wickedness—Grotius is forced to make up ground: God provides ample warning, laws,
threats, and promises, all of which are enforced with punishment or reward of the soul
after death.[13] Further, he ensures that states and even empires persist in order to keep
such acts from spreading too far. Even more, the knowledge of God’s laws is not
completely extinguished, especially with the Fall. Here, his consistent effort to reshape
natural law emerges, for once these laws are given by God, they are known in and of
themselves[14]—so much so that they apply “though we should even grant, what without
the greatest wickedness cannot be granted, that there is no God, or that he takes no care
of human affairs.”[15]
The best argument Grotius can muster is that the free individual is the cause of evil,
the one who through the exercise of that free will may choose to do evil. While free will
is in itself good, no less than an attribute of God bequeathed to human beings, the


exercise of that free will may result in moral evil: “Liberty of acting is not in itself evil,
but may be the cause of something that is evil.”[16] Hardly an original position, at least
in our day and age, for it is standard fare among theological liberals. In Grotius’s time, it
was still a fresh argument, following in some way in Erasmus’s footsteps rather than
those of Arminius. That is, it was consistent with Erasmus’s objections to Luther’s
argument that human beings have no free will,[17] except that now Grotius shapes it in
response to the sharper articulations of Reformed theologians.[18]
Retelling the Myth
But men did not long continue in this pure and innocent state of life, but applied themselves to various
Arts, whereof the symbol was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that is, of the knowledge of things which
one may use either well or ill.[19]
This engagement with the Fall gives rise to three repercussions of an economic nature.
Obviously, it leads to Grotius’s argument for the free-acting agent, whether an individual
or a private company, which may act on its own volition to foster good and punish evil.
It also brings us to the paradox of liberalism (as the ideological complement of
capitalism), not least because Grotius is an early ideologue of a core liberal idea—the free-
willing individual. Before we deal with those matters, we would like to explore another,
less expected, implication of this effort to reshape the doctrine of the Fall: Grotius’s
retelling of that narrative in terms of the emergence of private property. The significance
of this retelling lies in its engagement with the biblical text in terms of the theological
theme of the “fortuitous Fall” and by means of a significant displacement that assists this
reading.[20] Such an interpretation reads the sin of Adam and Eve as a happy event, for it
enabled salvation to take place. In Grotius’s hands, the fortuity is even more immediate
because the outcome of the Fall is desirable for human beings. In order to achieve this
move, he displaces the trouble and strife of the Fall to a later moment. Thus, while he
reads the act of Adam and Eve as relatively benign, it is only later, with the accounts of
Cain and Abel, the Flood, and then Babel that one encounters the evil desires and acts of
human beings, determined by jealousy, murder, ambition, and the search for pleasure.[21]
Through this rereading of the Fall, the retold myth becomes one of the earliest
articulations of a story that is to be developed until it becomes the infamous myth of
Adam Smith.
In the crucial twelfth chapter of De jure Praedae, which was the only section to be
published in Grotius’s lifetime as Mare Liberum (Freedom of the Seas),[22] Grotius


constructs a mythical narrative to account for the origin of property, law
, commerce,
states, and of those areas of the world that are neither private nor public property.[23] His
immediate objective is to arrive at an argument for the seas as outside the domain of
property relations, but in the process he constructs a story, a grand story that would be
taken up by those following in his wake. As is typical for Grotius’ humanist style, it
abounds with references to Greek and Roman authors, along with one or two medieval
ones (we have more to say on that later).[24] While one may be tempted to follow Grotius
into those works, that would miss the biblical tenor of his creative mythmaking.[25] He
begins by observing that we need to be careful about the terminology used, for common
possession (communio) and property (dominium) have different meanings now than they
had at the origins of human existence. In that context, communio meant what was
common over against the particular, and dominium meant the privilege of using common
property. Grotius seeks to show how the modern meanings arose, namely the distinction
between common or public property and private property.
He then writes:
There was no private property under the primary law of nations, to which we also give the name of “natural
law,” from time to time, and which the poets represent in some passages as prevailing in the Golden Age
while in other passages they assign it to the reign of Saturn or of Justice. . . . For in the eyes of nature no
distinctions of ownership were discernible. In this sense, then, we say that all things were common property
in those distant days, meaning just what the poets do when they declare that the men of earliest times made
acquisitions on behalf of the community, and that the communal character of goods was maintained by
justice in accordance with a sacred pact. In order to clarify this point, they explain that fields were not
divided by boundary lines in that age, and that there were no commercial transactions.[26]
Communal property was then the primal form, one that was according to nature, or
under the sway of his all-important “natural law
.” Yet, what are we to make of his
comment that this was not a barbaric and primitive state, but a “Golden Age”
characterized by justice? Here, Grotius is referencing the underlying theme of paradise,
the state of human existence in the garden before the Fall. In fact, this natural state was
divinely ordained, for “God had given all things, not to this or that individual, but to the
human race; and there was nothing to prevent a number of persons from being joint
owners, in this fashion, of one and the same possession.”[27] By no means a new theme,
this idea goes back to the arguments of the “Church Fathers,” Basil and Ambrose, that
the redemption of Christ means a return to the state of communal property. That is, they
read backwards, taking the image of the first Christians having “everything in common”
(Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35) as a sign of what it was like before the Fall—redemption being a
return, at least in part, to the prelapsarian state.[28] Elsewhere, Grotius indicates his


awareness of this argument, locating the communism of the early Christians (and those
who lived in such a way in his own day) within this simplicity of life characteristic of the
“primitive” age of human existence.[29] The first human beings (embodied in Adam and
Eve) were then the joint owners of a common possession, with neither private property
nor commerce anywhere to be seen. They were, of course, naked as well.[30] How then
did we arrive at our current state?
It is evident, however, that the present-day concept of distinctions in ownership was the result, not of any
sudden transition, but of a gradual process whose initial steps were taken under the guidance of nature
herself. For there are some things which are consumed by use, either in the sense that they are converted
into the very substance of the user and therefore admit of no further use, or else in the sense that they are
rendered less fit for additional service by the fact that they have once been made to serve. Accordingly, it
very soon became apparent, in regard to articles of the first class (for example, food and drink), that a certain
form of private ownership was inseparable from use. For the essential characteristic of private property is the
fact that it belongs to a given individual in such a way as to be incapable of belonging to any other
individual. This basic concept was later extended by a logical process to include articles of the second class,
such as clothing and various other things capable of being moved or of moving themselves. Because of
these developments, it was not even possible for all immovable things (fields, for instance) to remain
unapportioned, since the use of such things, while it does not consist directly in their consumption, is
nevertheless bound up with purposes of consumption (as it is when arable lands and orchards are used with a
view to obtaining food, or pastures for clothing), and since there are not enough immovable goods to
suffice for indiscriminate use by all persons.[31]
The key lies in use. If an object is used, it becomes one’s private property. In order to
reach this point, some deft footwork on Grotius’s part is required. He needs an account
of the transition from the divinely instituted state of nature to private property, a
transition that he depicts in his urbane style as gradual and negotiated. Yet, beneath that
text a number of struggles lie half-concealed. To begin with, Grotius must counter the
dominant direction of the biblical story of the Fall. Here use of the earth through tilling is
clearly a punishment, for the earth itself is cursed: “in toil you shall eat of it all the days of
your life . . . By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread” (Gen. 3:17 and 19).[32] In
going against the narrative of disobedience and rupture in the biblical text, Grotius also
takes his stand against the interpretation of the Church “Fathers” we mentioned earlier,
who argue that the transition from the common ownership of all goods to private
property was clearly a result of the Fall—the outcome being that redeemed human beings
should seek to return to the state of paradise. Here, we would like to note that Grotius also
counters his own interpretation of these verses in his annotations to the Old and New
Testament. He writes: “Non erit qualis Paradisus, qui te sponte natis alebat vegetumque
praestabat, sed subacta multo labore ne sic quidem puras fruges proferet (It will not be
like Paradise, which of its own accord fed its children and flourished, but having been


subdued through much labor it provided not even pure crops).”[33] Even here, Grotius
restricts the sense of the text to the production of food, refusing the interpretation of the
Church “Fathers.” Instead of property being the result of the Fall, all it means is:
“Plerumque poena peccato respondet, qui in cibo peccauerat, in cibo punitur
(Punishment for sin is usually reciprocal: he who has sinned in terms of food is punished
in terms of food).”[34] Grotius certainly keeps the idea of use far away from his
interpretation of Gen 3:17-19.
At another level, Grotius deploys the theme of the fortuitous nature of the Fall, for the
process leading to private property took place “under the guidance of nature.” This was
the way it had to develop if human beings were to progress to their current state. In a way
that breathes the sense that the Fall enabled the incarnation, cross, and redemption,
Grotius sees the process as one that was beneficial for human beings. Indeed, in De jure
Belli he interprets even the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in a beneficial
direction: it is a symbol of the “knowledge of things which one may use either well or
ill.” The first human beings needed to eat of the tree to their benefit, for they could not
“long continue in this pure and innocent state of life,” so they “applied themselves to
various arts,” for which the tree becomes the logo.[35] As we mentioned earlier, he is able
to make such an interpretive move by displacing the rupture of the Fall to later points,
especially with Cain and Abel, the flood, and Babel. In order to assist with this alternative
reading, he deploys other biblical texts in his favor. Gen. 1:29 comes to his aid, where
God tells the first human beings that they may have every plant and every tree for food
(barring the tree of good and evil), and Gen 9:3, in which the range of options for
sustenance is extended to everything that moves.[36] And in De jure Belli, Grotius refers to
the account of the allocation of wells between Abram and Abimelech (Gen. 21) as an
example of the gentler and negotiated process towards property.[37]
In light of these various moves, Grotius can develop his central idea of use. If a
human being makes use of some object, it becomes his or her property.[38] Notably,
Grotius focuses on exactly the same item—food—as the biblical texts do in his argument
for use as the key to private property (whether the fruit eaten by the woman and then the
man, or the food produced by sweat of the man’s brow). If we masticate and swallow
,
then the piece of fruit or bread becomes part of our bodies and is of no use to anyone
else. Only a short step needs be taken to arrive at a second category of items, such as
clothes and movables. Once the flax or wool has been picked, spun, and woven into a
garment, it gains a specific use for a particular person and is of less use for anyone else.
Yet before he gets to that point, when still discussing food, he has already given his


definition of private property: “The essential characteristic of private property is the fact
that it belongs to a given individual in such a way as to be incapable of belonging to any
other individual.”[39] Now it becomes obvious, or so he believes, to apply that definition
to the other category, which includes clothing and then movables and immovables.
While a rhetorically clever move, this reasoning is really a sleight of hand. There is no
clear reason why the eating of, say, a banana, makes it one’s private property. All that can
be said with certainty is that one has consumed a banana for the sake of sustenance
(though the potassium it contains is also good for one’s heart). If this reasoning is a
dubious move on Grotius’s part, then his extension of this principle to clothing and
movables is equally questionable.
Such thinking also conveniently ignores the actual history of private property
(dominium), which was invented by Roman jurists of the second century BCE in the
context of slavery. In contrast with Grotius’s myth, the invention of private property
emerged as a way of dealing with the multitude of slaves in the Roman world. By
defining a slave as a thing (res), these jurists were able to define private or absolute
property as a relationship with a thing rather than with other (legally defined) human
beings. Thus, absolute property was dominium ex jure Quiritium, lordship according to
the law of Roman citizens. Even more, such property meant the right to dispose perfectly
of a material thing insofar as it not forbidden by law: jus perfecte disponendi de re corporali
nisi lege prohibeatur. The term dominium (which first appears late in the second century
BCE) was chosen for good reason: the dominus was master over his slave, the thing in
question.[40] Since the studies that trace this development appear much later than
Grotius’s work, it may be possible to excuse him, but we do find it strange that one who
was so careful in citing ancient sources would overlook the crucial role of the Roman
jurists.
Grotius next considers the development of the law in his own way, but it is worth
noting that he leaves open (near the end of the previous quotation) the possibility that
some immovables were not apportioned as private property: not all immovables could
remain unapportioned, he writes. The “not all” implies that some objects remain outside
private property. This point becomes crucial in his argument for the free seas. To return
to his text:
The recognition of the existence of private property led to the establishment of a law on the matter, and this
law was patterned after nature’s plan. For just as the right to use the goods in question was originally
acquired through a physical act of attachment, the very source (as we have observed) of the institution of
private property, so it was deemed desirable that each individual’s private possessions should be acquired, as
such, through similar acts of attachment. This is the process known as “occupation” [occupatio], a


particularly appropriate term in connection with those goods which were formerly at the disposal of the
community.[41]
Within the narrative structure of the myth, private property emerges as people claim and
then divide among themselves items from the common pool. Having seen that this is
possible, human beings then hit on the bright idea that it may be extended to other items.
The consumption of food and use of clothes, the claim to a humble dwelling, and
perhaps a few sheep and goats—these give the sense that such appropriation or
occupation may then be applied to a water bottle or a cart, a toe tickler or an ear scratcher.
Elsewhere, Grotius makes it clear that the process of seizing property was not an affair of
the dim and distant past. It is ongoing, a feature of everyday human existence that
happens time and again. Thus, the second “law” in the prologue to De jure Praedae states:
“It shall be permissible to acquire for oneself, and to retain, those things which are useful
for life.”[42] In De Jure Belli, Grotius goes so far as to argue that if one takes from another
what is necessary for the preservation of one’s own life, it is not theft—even to the extent
of acquiring women for a hypothetical society in which there were only men.[43] The
crucial point remains that human beings need a structure of law
, which—as is usually
argued—arrives post factum. A law forbidding some act, such as sex with animals,
assumes that people are having sex with animals and that it is undesirable for them to do
so (Exod. 22:19; Lev
. 18:23; 20:15-16; Deut. 27:21).[44] So also, a law that stipulates a
certain process responds to a situation. In this case, it is the law concerning private
property, whether in Grotius’s narrative or in the actual invention by the Roman jurists.
However, we prefer the dialectical argument that the law itself produces the transgression
or the act in the first place.[45] That is, a certain act becomes illegal or legal only when the
law designates it so. Rather than giving expression to cultural norms, to codifying those
norms in a way that fixes them, the law functions to transform the act in question into
something forbidden or sanctioned. It thereby wishes to reshape cultural expectations,
usually in terms of the ideological agenda of a certain group that seeks influence and
power. Is it possible that the law’s imagination may also bring certain acts into
existence?
Once the law is in place within Grotius’s story, he elaborates upon the types of
conditions that count for private property.[46] First, he distinguishes between types of
possession, the one being continuous (as with wild animals that require domestication)
and the other, after an initial seizure, a condition that continues as a mental and legal
category. Second, he differentiates between what seizure (apprehensio) means for movables
and immovables, the former demanding physical seizure and the latter evidence of “some


activity involving construction or the definition of boundaries.”[47] This last point is
crucial regarding the oceans, for Grotius later argues that it is difficult to produce
evidence of having constructed anything on the open seas or of having defined clear
boundaries (apart from wharves and jetties on the shore). W
e leave aside the obvious
Eurocentrism of this observation, or at least the bias of those from particular modes of
production in which the construction of buildings and fixtures, along with the clear
demarcation of boundaries in land, is universalized as a distinct mark of possession. At
this stage of his mythic narrative, Grotius finds a place for the emergence of commerce
and states, overlooking all details of those matters for the sake of the final moment in the
story. He states:
Accordingly, we find that those things which were wrested from the original domain of common
ownership have been divided into two categories. For some are now public property, or in other words, they
are owned by the people, which is the true meaning of the expression “public property”; and others are
strictly private property, that is to say, they belong to individuals.
Nevertheless, occupancy of public possessions is achieved by the same method as occupancy of private
possessions . . . On the other hand, lands that did not fall into the possession of any nation in the process of
apportionment, are called by Thucydides aoriston, that is to say, “undefined” regions, marked by no fixed
limits.[48]
Grotius attempts to cover all bases. Of those items seized from common ownership, two
types emerge: public property owned by the people and private property owned by
individuals. However, another category exists, for which he leaves an opening with his
comment that “not all” immovables remain unapportioned. Therefore, some were
apportioned or seized and others remained as they were. This point enables him to
observe that some parts of the earth remain outside the grasping hands of individuals or
nations. These “undefined regions” exist without limits. Indeed, they can never be seized
as property due to their nature. He concludes:
From the foregoing discussion, two inferences may be drawn. The first runs as follows: those things which
are incapable of being occupied, or which never have been occupied, cannot be the private property of any
owner, since all property has its origin as such in occupancy. The second inference may be stated thus: all
those things which have been so constituted by nature that, even when used by a specific individual, they
nevertheless suffice for general use by other persons without discrimination, retain today and should retain
for all time that status which characterized them when first they sprang from nature.[49]
The first point is to be expected from the earlier story, for anything that simply cannot be
occupied remains outside the domain of property. Here, Grotius makes a subtle but
crucial shift: common ownership does not mean “everybody’s property” (as at creation)
but rather “nobody’s property.” No one is the rightful owner, but so also is no one


excluded.[50] This enables Grotius to argue that seas and oceans,[51] wastelands through
which wild animals roam, and even the air, are precisely such items; thereby, they remain
open for anyone to use and cross. He then slides in the second point, even though the
myth does not explicitly mention it earlier: even if someone uses such an item (given that
use is a sign of claiming property), this does not preclude others from doing so, since by
their nature such areas cannot become property. Translated, this means that sailing across
a sea does not give one the right to claim that sea as private or public property. Of course,
this final observation is meant to counter the Portuguese[52] argument that sailing across
the seas to the Indies gave them ownership of those seas, to the exclusion of others.
What should be made of this myth? W
e have already indicated our objections at
various points concerning the speciousness of the claim that use entails property or that
law follows on practice, and we have pointed out that Grotius’s tale of the emergence of
property is far from what really happened. Likewise, we have emphasized that this tale
amounts to a myth, a grand narrative for the sake of bolstering a specific argument
concerning Dutch commercial desires in the Indies. The problem with myth, of course,
is that pointing out its flaws or laying out facts rarely dents its power. The reason is not
merely that myth provides a motivation that can withstand such criticisms, but that myth
also has a double meaning in light of its checkered history.[53] It is simultaneously fiction
and deeper truth, a made-up story and one that expresses (through metaphoric language)
a truth that cannot be expressed in conventional forms. What is the deeper truth of this
myth? It provides one of the earliest instances of a myth that would become vital for the
ideology of capitalism. In modified form, it turns up in Locke, Malthus, and Smith,
thereby becoming the greatest story ever told in the development of economic theory.
That such a story is a refashioned version of the Fall, understood now in terms of its
fortuitous meaning, only enhances its status and power as myth.
The Paradox of Liberalism
God made man a free agent, and at liberty to do ill or well.[54]
Grotius’s retelling of the Fall narrative—or rather, the creation of a parallel version—sets in
train several features that we mentioned earlier, one being the free agent with rights,
which leads to the paradox of liberalism. The temptation on these matters is to become
lost in natural law theory, a temptation we seek to avoid so as to focus on the economic
ramifications.[55] W
e wish to make two points here. First, a central feature of later classical
and then neoclassical economic theory emerges already in the work of Grotius from a


specific theological engagement, an engagement that is subsequently suppressed while
the ideological position is maintained. By this we mean the rationally acting individual
who possesses rights and operates in terms of self-interest and sociality. In due course,
this rationally calculating individual will come to be known as homoeconomicus, but the
seeds of this idea already appear in the work of Grotius in the context of both the Dutch
commercial empire and theological debates. Second, the paradox of liberalism—in which
freedom is proclaimed for “all” when “all” is always a universal by exclusion—appears in
Grotius’s writings. Liberalism was to become the dominant and perpetually adapted
ideological framework of capitalism, to which those of conservative and progressive
tendencies find themselves forced to adapt.[56] The argument is often made that Grotius
saw through the glass darkly, that his thought is still too mingled with medieval strands
and needs later theorists to clarify its meaning. W
e wish to take a different tack, for
Grotius embodies a paradox that is constitutive of the ideology of liberalism.
As we pointed out earlier, one result of Grotius’s struggles with his Reformed
opponents in the Netherlands is the development of his argument (in accord with
Arminius) that a human being is a free-willing individual. This free will was the result of
the Holy Spirit’s work (prevenient grace), which undermines the effects of the Fall and
enables human beings to respond positively and negatively to God’s grace. It also means
that human beings are the source of both good and evil.
Ultimately, this argument concerns human nature. Far as his thoughts are from
Calvin’s (W
eberians take note), the ramifications are ominous for economic theory. His
basic position appears in two sections of his major works, in the second chapter of De
jure Praedae and in the prologue of De jure Belli.[57] For Grotius, human nature operates in
a tension between self-interest (a self-love that seeks the good for oneself) and “an
exquisite desire of society.”[58] Of the two, the former tends to dominate, so much so that
the reason human beings opt to be part of society (or of a state) is because it is to their
profit to do so.[59] Largely the same opposition appears in the works of Locke, Malthus,
Smith, and J. S. Mill, but Grotius also introduces a proposition that will become central to
that ideal construct of classical economics, the homo economicus. These dual forces within
human beings operate not according to base passions but to the “sovereign attribute of
reason.”[60] This power of reason is, for Grotius, the result of God imprinting on human
beings the rational workings of God’s own mind. To be sure, such a faculty may be
darkened by sin and vice, but the “divine light” of reason shines more strongly.[61] The
function of reason appears not merely as content, but also in the form of Grotius’s urbane
and carefully measured writing. He was, after all, a lawyer and diplomat, and for such a


person the carefully worded statement and argument is the highest aim of a thinker and
writer. But it is also the dimension of God’s mind bequeathed to human beings,
enabling them to function by that rather useful presence of prevenient grace. Grotius will
have none of the groveling depravity of Calvin’s doctrine of the Fall.
For our purposes, this eminently theological discussion of human nature entails a
number of ramifications. In the first place, the argument is not only theological but also
ethical. Given that ethics is the preserve of the false universal of the ruling class,[62] we
suggest that this search for a universal nature seeks to reshape greed as benign self-
interest—or, as Grotius puts it, self-love. That is, it pushes the notion of the fortuitous Fall
as far as it will go, to the extent that the human beings banished from the garden and
scraping a soil full of thistles and thorns in the sweat of their brows are now transformed
into entrepreneurs who seek their own benefit – rationally calculated of course. Further,
by focusing on human nature, Grotius shows the tendency to universalize from a
particular economic and class situation. As human nature, that nature becomes universal
to all, a move that enacts one of the most stunning acts of ethnocentrism, let alone class-
centrism and econo-centrism. This method of reasoning becomes necessary for the later
creation, from the brains of classical economists, of homo economicus, a creation that has
little connection with the real world.
In linking the free-willing individual with the rational man (we choose the word
deliberately) who balances his self-interest with a social imperative, Grotius produces a
powerful actor indeed: “Absolute power every man has over his own actions.”[63] Or, more
extensively:
God created man autexousion, “free and sui iuris,” so that the actions of each individual and the use of his
possessions were made subject not to another’s will but to his own. Moreover, this view is sanctioned by the
common consent of all nations. For what is that well-known concept, “natural liberty,” other than the power
of the individual to act in accordance with his own will? And liberty in regard to actions is equivalent to
ownership in regard to property. Hence the saying: “every man is the governor and arbiter of affairs relative
to his own property.”[64]
Of course, this statement is true of only that small segment of a socio-economic system
in charge of their own affairs, and not of a good many others subject to them. But it also
means that such human beings may act for good or evil—recall Grotius’s position that
we may accept or reject God’s grace, but remember also his belief that human free will is
the source of evil in the world. This position leads him to conclude that evil deeds must
be punished and good deeds recompensed.[65] Yet, this mechanism of punishment and
recompense does not merely involve states and their judiciaries (an argument that one


might expect), but is also the task of individuals.[66] At one level, this argument makes
sense within the logic of Grotius’s own system. If these laws constitute part of the
natural law
, laid down by God but according to universal principles (for God wills only
what is just), then an individual may act on these laws. At another level, it enables
Grotius to make the rather convenient argument that Dutch mariners were justified in
seizing Portuguese ships. W
e speak not of a fleet of Dutch war ships under the direction
of the government but of individual captains working for a private company in the
distant seas of the Indies, far from the practices of W
estern European customs and laws.
Grotius’s case in point (and the reason he wrote De jure Praedae) involved the famous
capture of the Portuguese carrack Santa Catarina by the Dutch captain, Jabob van
Heemskerck, on February 25, 1603. The seized cargo was sold in Amsterdam later that
year for no less than three million Dutch guilders. Grotius’s genius enabled him to find—
via theological, philosophical, and legal argumentation—a perfectly good reason for such
an act. As rational, free-willing actors, the Portuguese had willingly violated the laws of
nature by claiming the seas as their own, but the Dutch captain also acted in accordance
with those principles by punishing them for such an act. Of course, he was also an agent
of a sovereign and independent Dutch state – asserted by the Dutch at the time but
certainly not recognized by the Spanish, among others. That Grotius’s argument was
eminently suitable for those with whom he worked so closely, the directors of Dutch East
India Company (VOC) was merely icing on the cake.
Not unexpectedly, few theorists since have been willing to pursue this argument to its
relentless conclusion in the way Grotius does. However, they have been more than willing
to develop another ramification of his reflections on human nature in terms of human
rights. For Grotius, right (ius) can pertain either to a community or state (with a view to
the right of war) or to an individual person.[67] That right is defined as “a moral quality
annexed to the person, enabling him to have, or do, something justly.”[68] When
perfected, it becomes a “faculty,” but when still under development, it remains an
“aptitude.” In other words, a right is something owned and exercised by an individual
human being who has the power and means to do so.[69] It joins the long list of items
that count as private property, seized from the common pool and then legally encircled.
But what does such a right entail? The plurality of rights Grotius outlines includes: the
right to liberty (in relation to oneself and thereby without hindrance from an outside
authority like the state), the right to maintain control over others (such as children and
slaves), the right to property, and the right to demand what is due to one or owing.[70]
While three of these points usually make liberals salivate, the right concerning slavery


makes them squirm. As we will argue, the tension between liberty and slavery embodies
the paradox at the heart of liberalism. However, we would first like to focus on the last
item: the right to demand what is owed. To be sure, Grotius’s seismic shift[71] in the
understanding of rights took some time to gain traction, but when it did this feature of
rights undergirded one political movement after another in the context of bourgeois
democracy. Previously, Grotius had given voice to the liberal slogans concerning the
right to self-defense and the right to private property, especially of the things that are
useful for life.[72] Many more would be added after him, so that the claim to rights
became a powerful weapon indeed: the rights to food, shelter, and clothing; indigenous
rights to land and to be counted as citizens of the bourgeois state; the civil rights of
African Americans in the United States; the right of women to assert absolute control
over their own bodies, thereby sanctioning abortion; the rights of gays and lesbians to be
married; the rights of children as individuals; the rights of refugees and asylum seekers to
fair process; the right of workers to strike; indeed, human rights as such . . .  The list is
almost endless; and it relies upon the proposition that Grotius first proposed, that a right
is a possession of an individual. However, given the nascent liberal framework of his
ideas, any claim to a right means both acquiescence to that framework and admission to
the liberal club—or rather, to bourgeois democracy.[73]
The shift to identifying rights as the property of individual human beings also means
that these rights came to be seen as commodities. In other words, they enter the network
of commodities within capitalism in which commodities are defined as the products of
human labor. These commodities operate at the intersection between use value and
exchange value, and the powers of the social interaction of labor—which now appear as
the social relations between things—transfer to them.[74] As commodities, rights can be
exchanged. They can be sold and traded in exchange for other commodities. A common
example: the way employers meet demands from workers by asking them to trade away
certain rights that have been gained in previous struggles. This might include holiday
pay, sick leave, or job security. W
e would like to point out that rights are a far cry from
inalienable property, for they also have a price.[75]
Immediately flowing out of Grotius’s early articulation of some core liberal doctrines
is the paradox of liberalism itself. W
e focus here on the tension between the individual
and the collective, followed by the universal of exclusion. On both counts, liberal
commentators take a standard line: Grotius’s account is still mired in all manner of
seventeenth-century (if not medieval) concerns, to the extent that the full realization of
these doctrines would take some time. The problem with this argument is twofold: as


standard liberal fare, it holds onto a myth of an ideal, fully realized future; yet if such a
future were to be achieved, the whole system would come crashing down. The reason is
that the very structure of that ideology is built on the hindrances to that future, on the
hurdles that seem to be perpetually in the way.[76] In other words, it is the contradictions
that make liberalism work, and Grotius provides an excellent, early example of those
contradictions.
The first contradiction may be dealt with swiftly. Grotius deliberately postulates two
forces at work in human nature—self-interest and social need. Some liberal critics are
keen to emphasize the former at the expense of the latter,[77] but they miss the real import
of Grotius’s opposition between the two terms. W
e do not mean that Grotius seeks a
careful balance or Aristotelian mean; rather, we make a dialectical point that unfolds from
Grotius’s argument. Precisely because everyone thinks they are autonomous individuals,
working for their own benefit, they are united with all those who share the same
ideology. That is, in their very individuality they manifest their collectivity; or even more
sharply, they achieve such a collective identity through that curious claim to being a self-
seeking private individual.
The more important paradox concerns the universal by exclusion: liberalism operates
by claiming that individual freedom is a universal, but it can be a universal only by
excluding those who do not fit the agenda—who oppose it, espousing a different
ideology. Even more, liberalism needs to keep the majority outside the scope of freedom
as the very condition of this liberty.[78] Grotius provides a wonderful example of this
paradox. While he argues that the free-willing and autonomous individual can choose
good and evil—as well as enjoy rights to liberty, private property, self-defense, and to
what one is owed—he also argues that this individual has the right to lord it over others.
Two telling examples are given, the first sliding into the second. He writes that one has a
right to power “over others, such as that of a father over his children, or a lord over his
slave.”[79] This is a characteristic tactic in his argumentation, moving from the obvious
and easy point in order to make a more contentious point (as we saw with his myth of
private property, where he moved from food consumed to movables and immovables). Of
course, one nods, a parent has the right to direct and control children, for they are
dependent and helpless without the exercise of power.[80] But then, Grotius shifts to the
slave, who is in a similar state:
Now perfect and utter slavery, is that which obliges a man to serve his master all his life long, for diet and
other common necessaries; which indeed, if it be thus understood, and confined within the bounds of
nature, has nothing too hard and severe in it; for that perpetual obligation to service, is recompensed by the
certainty of being always provided for.[81]


To complete the circle begun with the father and his children, Grotius opines that parents,
especially if slaves themselves, may sell their children into slavery, with due consideration
for their well-being.[82]
One can trace a slight shift in Grotius’s argument concerning slaves between the
earlier De jure Praedae and the later De jure Belli. In De jure Praedae, Grotius asserts that
lording it over a slave is a right comparable to liberty and private property (which a slave
is for Grotius). And he agrees with Aristotle’s assertion that “certain persons are by nature
slaves, not because God did not create man as a free being, but because there are some
individuals whose character is such that it is expedient for them to be governed by
another’s sovereign will rather than by their own.”[83] In the later De jure Belli, he is at
times less comfortable with this argument,[84] so he proposes an alternative: people may,
through a rational weighing of the benefits and losses, voluntarily give up the right to
freedom and become slaves. Thus, just as a man may sell his labor, so also is it “lawful for
any man to engage himself as a slave to whom he pleases.”[85]
W
e have used the example of slavery quite deliberately, for it highlights not so much
an uneven contribution to liberalism—a body of thought mingled with non-liberal
themes—as an inadvertent insight into the paradox of liberalism itself. To offer another
telling example: the liberal clarion call for equality, freedom, and liberal democracy in the
establishment of the United States depended upon and was sustained by the systematic
slavery of Africans and the displacement of indigenous peoples. In addition, the claim
that “all men are created equal before God” in the Constitution of the United States of
America was written by slave owners (as was the Declaration of Independence). “All men”
is therefore a universal by exclusion, for not all count as “men.”[86] The objection may be
made that slavery was eventually overcome and that indigenous people were given land
rights. One might respond by pointing out the continued relegation of these people to
lower working class status (as much out of work as in it) and the high rates of substance
abuse, violence, and prison occupancy. One might also counter that while the line may
shift, it always demarcates those outside the liberal definition of “freedom.” Thus, during
the “Progressive Era” at the turn of the twentieth century, numerous “democratic” reforms
took place (secret ballots, primaries, referenda, and so on) precisely in the context of
intense Ku Klux Klan terrorist activity and efforts to assimilate indigenous people. Even
today, the United States systematically continues the liberal project by designating some
states as “rogues” and “pariahs.”[87] These “rogue” states may then be destroyed by the
“world’s oldest democracy” in the name of freedom and democracy. The examples may
be multiplied,[88] but we want to draw attention to Grotius’s early indications of the deep


paradox of liberalism’s universal by exclusion. If they won’t join us, they are obviously
not partakers of the universal “all”—so crush them.
Class, or, The View from the Height
Who were men of good judgement, and no small learning.[89]
To your publick actions you have, to compleat the measure of justice, added such innocence and
sanctity of life, as deserves the admiration, not of men only, but of the blessed above.[90]
One would hardly expect otherwise, for Grotius gives voice to the contradictions inherent
in any ruling class ideology. That he should be writing in the context of the first
commercial empire of capitalism only makes his work all the more revealing, particularly
in light of his attempt to work through to a new form of that ideology. Like Arminius,
[91] Grotius was very much part of the emerging bourgeois dominance within a country
that had turned its small size and marginal status into a hub of European commerce. His
family counted itself among the regents of the town of Delft and part of the new
oligarchy that remembered vividly the struggle of the United Provinces against Spanish
colonial dominance a generation before. This ruling class status was not due to some
tattered aristocratic lineage; rather, they were beneficiaries of the Dutch Baltic trade, as
well as the more illustrious but less profitable V
erenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC),
which set the standard for the relatively vast corporations that would later fuel European
colonialism. The result of the amalgamation of a number of the smaller companies in
1602, the VOC generated more revenue in its first year than the English government. As
shareholders in the company, the De Groots were on the board of its Delft “chamber.” As
van Ittersum has argued, much of Grotius’s work was both in service to and stimulated
by the new issues that arose from the vigorous activities of the VOC.[92] Not
surprisingly, the acts of the VOC would form the substance of Grotius’s first major
work, De jure Praedae, in which he generated the first articulation of “free” trade, which
would later become a standard premise of classical economics.
Given such a background, Grotius inevitably gained a typical humanist education:
he read the texts from ancient Greece and Rome, studied rhetoric, and used Latin in
verbal and written communication with his fellow humanists. Apart from these signals of
ruling class assumptions, he also championed liberal tolerance, seeking to unite the
various political and theological groups. In the same vein as Arminius’s 1606 address,
“On Reconciling Religious Dissensions among Christians,” Grotius wrote that like the
early Christians who knew no sect or faction, he sought to show that “there was no one


sect that had discovered all truth, nor any but what held something that was true.”[93] The
truth could be found only through the discovery of common ground and the eschewal of
factional struggles. This motive underlies The Truth of the Christian Religion, in which he
sought to unite Protestants and Roman Catholics. It should come as no surprise that, in
his last years, Grotius undertook the task of ambassador for Sweden. A good, liberal
project, is it not? Yet, liberal tolerance is always proposed by “men of good judgment,
and of no small learning”[94]—that is, from a position of ruling class power—for
tolerance seeks to leave the status quo as it is. “Toleration, sure, but only insofar as you
recognize our position of influence.” Or, more perniciously: “Tolerance yes, but on our
terms.”
Another signal of Grotius’s class assumptions directly bears on later developments of
classical economic theory. W
e mean not merely the fact that most of those who followed
after him spoke in terms of a ruling class, but also the tendency to pack his texts with
quotations and references to classical Greek and Latin authors, along with a few medieval
scholastics. Obviously, this practice was a result of his humanist education, but it
produces an effect that would become important in the later imperialism of classical and
then neoclassical economic theory. In attempting to harmonize ancient sources with
another ancient source—namely, the Bible—Grotius undertakes some deft exegetical
work to deal with their differences.[95] Yet, this harmonization also functions in a
temporal way; the ancients come to be no different from ourselves. They too were
interested in the free individual with rights; they too saw the development of private
property and commerce as beneficial; they too agree with us. Above all, they too were
nascent capitalists. Here lie the seeds of economics imperialism, in which capitalist
impulses are simply part of human nature and history becomes the grand narrative of
capitalism’s unfolding.
Looking forward: Grotius fires off a number of trajectories that become important for
the other theorists with whom we deal in this book. These are the construction of a myth
that wrestles with the biblical story of the Fall but sets out on a new path. Locke, Malthus,
and Smith also deal in myth, reshaping what they have inherited while staying geared
toward the features of capitalism they saw springing up around them. Theology and
especially the Bible play significant roles for Locke and Malthus, while Smith occupies a
transition point. W
e also find replicated the paradox of liberalism and its false universal,
which closely connects with the inescapable ruling class assumptions they bring to their
texts. In the case of these later theorists, a virulent ethnocentrism ultimately reveals the lie
of their universal claims.


However, we would like to finish on a different note, one that is germane to Grotius. It
concerns the nature of his Arminian theology and economic theory—specifically, the
way it questions W
eber’s well-known proposal regarding Calvinism as the vanishing
mediator of capitalism.[96] For W
eber, the particular nature of Calvinism provided the
enabling ideological structure for the emergence of capitalism, in the Netherlands and
then the United Kingdom. If we grant W
eber’s methodological assumptions for a
moment, then he has missed his target. Those who took up a Reformed position tended
to come from the poorer, peasant and new working class areas of the United Provinces.
These were the same people who had been enamored with the radical and revolutionary
currents of Anabaptism not long before. But amidst the commercial ruling elite (among
whom Grotius was a leading ideologue), Arminianism was far more popular. Here, we
find the rewritten myths of the emergence of capitalism, the assertion of the free
individual, and the paradoxes of liberalism. Perhaps, it would be better to speak of the
Arminian ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

The History of an Idea from Greek Philosophy to Grotian Jurisprudence,” Grotiana 30 (2009): 20–48. A
comparable avoidance of the struggle with the biblical text in developing his thought concerning private
property appears in Stumpf, The Grotian Theology of International Law: Hugo Grotius and the Moral
Foundations of International Relations, 169–76; Stephen Buckle, Natural Law and the Theory of Property:
Grotius to Hume (Oxford: Clarendon, 1991).
21. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, II.2.2. Efforts to reinterpret biblical themes in light of his own
argument appear repeatedly in his works. For instance, in the long discussion of self-defence, he writes, “The
Christian Religion commands, that we should lay down our Lives one for another; but who will pretend to
say, that we are obliged to this by the Law of Nature.” Ibid., I.2.6. See also his efforts to argue that Christians
can and must seize booty in war, with a heavy emphasis on the story of Abraham’s raid in Genesis 14.
Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 51–88. It is worth noting that in the prologue of the


second edition of De jure Bellli, he revised the text to make it more palatable to Reformed theology, as a way
to ease his aborted attempt to return to the Netherlands from exile.
22. Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 315–21; Hugo Grotius, The Freedom of the Seas
(Kitchener: Batoche Books, 2000 [1609]). Mare Liberumappeared in March 1609 at the request of the
directors of the VOC while they were engaged in the Ibero-Dutch negotiations for the Twelve Years Truce
(signed on April 9, 1609). The full text of De iure Praedae commentarius was published more than 250 years
after he wrote the work. Somewhat fortuitous was the discovery, for it had been placed in a box, only to be
discovered when his descendants auctioned (through the bookseller and printer Martinus Nijhoff) some of
Grotius’s papers in 1864. Subsequently acquired by the University of Leiden Library, the first edition
appeared in 1868 under the editorship H. G. Hamaker, a former student of the university. In what follows, we
cite De jure Praedae as Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty.
23. A more disjointed version appears in the second book of the later De jure Belli (Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and
Peace, II.2.2–3). We refer to it where appropriate, but since its digressions make it less clear than the version of
the myth in De jure Praedae, we focus on that version in our analysis.
24. Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Quintilian, Ovid, and Thucydides make appearances in the myth.
25. Schermaier, “Res Communes Omnium: The History of an Idea from Greek Philosophy to Grotian
Jurisprudence.”
26. Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 316.
27. Ibid., 317. In De jure Belli, nature becomes “almighty God,” who gave common dominion at creation and
after the Deluge. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, II.2.2.
28. See the references in Schermaier, “Res Communes Omnium: The History of an Idea from Greek Philosophy to
Grotian Jurisprudence,” 30–31.
29. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, II.2.6. He even keeps open the possibility that communal property may
become viable again in some later situations.
30. Ibid., II.2.2.
31. Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 317–18.
32. This text will also become a stumbling block for John Locke and Thomas Malthus.
33. Hugo Grotius, Hugonis Grotii Annotationes in V
etus & Novum T
estamentum (Farmington Hills: Gale Ecco,
2010 [1727]), 12.
34. Ibid., 12.
35. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, II.2.2. Here, he seems to follow Philo’s allegorical reading in which the
tree becomes an instance of a “middle prudence” (phronēsin mesēn). Indeed, these “arts” become the initiative
of the entrepreneurial nature of human beings: “Because men no longer contented with what the earth
produced of itself for their nourishment; being no longer willing to dwell in caves, to go naked, or covered
only with the barks of trees, or the skins of wild beasts, wanted to live in a more commodious and more
agreeable manner; to which end labour and industry was necessary, which some employed for one thing, and
others for another” (ibid., II.2.2). Even the death-struggle of Cain and Abel becomes a manifestation of the
most ancient arts, crop growing and feeding cattle.
36. Ibid., II.2.2.
37. Ibid., II.2.2.
38. As he puts it in the second chapter of De jure Praedae, since “‘what had been seized as his own’ by each person
should become the property of that person. Such seizure is called possessio (the act of taking possession), the
forerunner of usus (use), and subsequently of dominium (ownership)” Grotius, Commentary on the Law of
Prize and Booty, 24.
39. Ibid., 317.
40. A number of studies trace this development in detail, as well as the subsequent loss of the idea of private


property and its gradual recovery until it became a centerpiece of capitalism. Perry Anderson, Passages from
Antiquity to Feudalism (London: Verso, 1974), 65–67; H. F
. Jolowicz, Historical Introduction to the Study of
Roman Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), 142–43, 426; Andrew Linklater, International
Relations: Critical Concepts in Political Science (New York: Routledge, 2000), 1432; Orlando Patterson, Slavery
and Social Death: A Comparative Study (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), 31; David Graeber, Debt:
The First 5,000 Years (New York: Melville House, 2011), 199–201, 205, 290; Schermaier, “Res Communes

Romans 7.

52. Grotius generally designates the Portuguese as Spanish, since Portugal was under control of the Spanish
crown, with whom the Dutch were engaged in a protracted struggle for independence.

58. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I. Prol. 7; see also Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty,
24–28, 39–41. Reiterations of these two principles appear repeatedly in his texts, at times with small
differences. In De jure Praedae, the relationship between them is mutually cooperative, with self-interest being
the first attribute of human beings (through a nature created by God) and sociality the second. Grotius is
keen to indicate that self-interest does not mean greed but a beneficial desire based on love and justice.
However, in De jure Belli, the relationship between them is more fractious, for the social impulse counters the
excessive focus on the self, especially against those who assert that self-interest serves as the only basis for
human existence. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I. Prol. 5–7. His revision of the prologue—in which
he plays down the focus on self-interest to assuage his Reformed critics— resulted in a tense relationship
between the two,.
59. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I. Prol. 17.
60. Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 24; see also Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I. Prol.
13. See also his comments on the human faculties of “prudent management” and “sound judgment,” which


enable one to discern the pleasant from the hurtful. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I. Prol. 9–10. The
social role of justice enhances this situation, operating according to a calculus of equality and compensation.

ears: On Marxism and Theology V, 245–86.
63. Grotius, The T
ruth of the Christian Religion, 1.24. Or, as rule three in De jure Praedae puts it, “What each
individual has indicated to be his will, that is law with respect to him.” Grotius, Commentary on the Law of
Prize and Booty, 34. In the last pages of the second chapter of that work, he offers a balance to this assertion,
suggesting that individuals are also subject to the judiciaries of states and even international agreements.
64. Grotius, Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 33–34; see also Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace,
I.3.8. Grotius’s theory of the state, as a collection of individuals, follows through the implications of this
argument concerning the autonomous individual: “The will of individuals, manifested either in the formal
acceptance of pacts, as was originally the case, or in tacit indication of consent, as in later times, when each
individual attached himself to the body of a commonwealth that had already been established.” Grotius,
Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty, 36.

Commercial Sociability in Early Modern International Legal Thought,” Grotiana 31 (2010): 22–43, 31–32.
67. Ever wary not to undermine the legitimacy of a state, Grotius goes on to clarify that the right of the state is
superior to that of the individual. Grotius, The Rights of W
ar and Peace, I.1.6. In doing so, he has let the
individual cat out of the collective bag.

of its agenda.

“fetishism of commodities.” Karl Marx, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, V
