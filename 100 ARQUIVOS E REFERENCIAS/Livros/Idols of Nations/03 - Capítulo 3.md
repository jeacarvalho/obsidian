John Locke and the Trouble with Adam
As Adam was turned out of Paradise, so all his Posterity were born out of it, out of the reach of the T
ree of Life, All
like their Father Adam in a state of Mortality, void of the T
ranquility and Bliss of Paradise.[1]
 
In comparison with Grotius, John Locke led a somewhat less exciting life. Instead of
shipwrecks,[2] Locke gave up a university post to tutor the children of an obscenely
wealthy and mildly progressive Whig; instead of holding an ambassadorial post, he
opted to remain quietly at home and write; instead of fighting robustly for a cause, he
hid his authorship of any work he suspected might be ever so slightly controversial;
instead of public life, he remained excessively secretive.[3] Locke was known to be
pedantic, quick to take offence, and singularly lacking a sense of humor. Despite all this,
he provides an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the Bible and economic theory.
W
e focus on his two “Treatises of Government,” drawing (where appropriate) from
his curious The Reasonableness of Christianity.[4] The core issues for our analysis of Locke
concern human nature and the origins of labor and of private property.[5] In both cases,
his theoretical efforts turn on and are often tripped up by the biblical text of Genesis 1–3.
[6] Why this text? If one wished to develop a new theory of human nature in Locke’s time
(although he was already working in a tradition that goes back to Grotius), then the
obvious person with whom to begin was that primal clod,[7] Adam. Here, surely, is the
paradigm of human nature, for God created him directly (Eve barely rates a mention).[8]
The problem is that the near obsessive concern with identifying an eternal human nature
took place at a time when human nature itself was changing with the spread of
capitalism. As for labor and private property, the early chapters of Genesis too were where
one began analysis. Labor is clearly one of the curses of the Fall (Gen. 3:17-19), so if one


wished to develop an alternative myth, parts of Genesis needed to be reinterpreted and
rewritten. In light of these themes—human nature and property—we have organized the
following analysis in two sections: the first focuses on Adam and the second on Locke’s
reworking of the origin myth of property and labor. In the initial section, we trace the
way Locke’s ideas on freedom, reason, and self-interest emerge from his deliberations
over Adam. More explicitly, they emerge from his debates with Robert Filmer, who
sought to argue that absolute monarchy derives from Adam.[9] Locke disagreed, and in
the process developed his positions. Although they may be stated (often repeatedly) in the
celebrated second treatise on government, they are initially formulated in the first treatise
where the debate with Filmer and the close engagement with Genesis take place. The
following section of our analysis focuses on Locke’s myth of the origins of property and
labor. Not only is this myth a retelling of the story the Fall in Genesis 1–3, but it also
serves as a reworking and extension of Grotius’s earlier version of the myth. At this point,
we also draw upon The Reasonableness of Christianity, in which Locke faces squarely the
problem of the Fall. In a daring reinterpretation of the Fall, he restricts its consequences
to one man alone: Adam brings mortality into the world. Locke thereby effaces the other
consequences, especially concerning labor as a punishment for disobedience. This leaves
him plenty of scope to develop an alternative story in which labor, and therefore property,
are the outcome of God’s command to subdue the earth. W
e continue to give close
attention to this foundation myth of classical economic theory, for it would be retold and
reformulated by those who came after Locke.
Since we deal extensively with Locke’s theological, or rather biblical, arguments, a
preliminary comment on his theological preferences should be made. Locke’s position
may seem initially to be a theological mix, adhering to no single direction. His desire to
base his thoughts in the Bible alone makes him seem somewhat Reformed, yet he had
little interest in the “systems of Divinity.” Locke famously wrote, “The holy scripture is
to me, and always will be, the constant guide of my assent; and we shall always hearken
to it, as containing infallible truth, relating to things of the highest concernment.”[10]
However, he had specific ideas as to how that guide should be read: the “drift of the
discourse” rather than proof-texts; the supposed historical context in which the texts were
written rather than elaborate theological formulations; the “plain and intelligible”
meaning (that is, “reasonableness”) of the text, understandable by the poor and common
man, rather than the “superfine distinctions of the schools.”[11] The result was an
approach that regarded faith as intellectual and moral assent to basic propositions found
in the Bible, especially those sections Locke deemed most historical.[12] Beneath this


distinct and (for his time) reasonably modern approach to the Bible lies an undercurrent
that links him to none other than Hugo Grotius. One of Locke’s two favorite theologians
was Philipp van Limborch.[13] A leading Remonstrant of the generation following
Grotius, Limborch (1633–1712) was also a member of the ruling class. After studying
theology, he ministered to Remonstrant parishes in Gouda and later Amsterdam, where
he also became professor of theology at the Remonstrant college. In that capacity, he was
often called upon to deal with matters of practical theology and ecclesial organization,
but he also corresponded (in Latin) with leading intellectuals in Germany, France, and
especially England. Besides writing frequently to Locke, his personal and intellectual
friend, Limborch managed to write several major works of Remonstrant theology,
including the first systematic exposition of that theology.[14] In Limborch’s work, Locke
seemed most at home; or rather, he found that his own conclusions accorded well with
those of Limborch.[15] These include: opposition to the Calvinist doctrine of election;
abhorrence of the idea that God could be the author of sin; the position that faith requires
obedience to basic propositions, upon which all Christians may agree—especially that
Jesus Christ is Lord and Messiah; a desire to find unity and tolerance among the many
forms of Christianity through these simple propositions;[16] ruling class proclivities that
included an abhorrence of revolution; but especially—for our purposes—his tendency to
limit the effects of the Fall, thereby attributing a great deal of importance to human
agency in terms of freedom. Indeed, Locke’s positioning of himself as an independent
Christian seeking a simple, biblical message as the basis for peace and understanding
drew him closest to the Arminians.[17]
Something about Adam
Every man had a right to the creatures by the same title Adam had, viz. by the right every one had to take
care of and provide for their subsistence: and thus men had a right in common, Adam’s children in common
with him.[18]
The topic is human nature, and the focus is Adam. Locke searches for a new theory of
human nature, albeit one that he sought to reinforce and develop, rather than create ex
nihilo. In Adam one may, feels Locke, finds insights concerning freedom, reason, self-
interest, property, and labor. Yet Adam is not as cooperative as Locke would like, twisting
this way and that as Locke attempts to tie him down. The reason? Adam is caught
between paradigm and exception. Thus, Locke’s assumption is that as the first, Adam
provides insights into the truth of human nature, offering a paradigm for all his posterity.


He is everyman, common to all. At the same time, Adam is the exception, the one who is
different from all of us. He was directly created, walked with God, experienced a state of
perfection no one has been able to match.[19] Most importantly, Adam cannot be
extracted from the narrative in which he is found—a narrative of creation, of a flawed
paradise, of disobedience, and of a fall from grace. That story may have bequeathed to
Locke the tension between everyman and singular man, but it also tied him to the story
of the Fall, a story that left Locke with more problems than answers.
Given that the first treatise of government is usually ignored in analysis—dismissed as
arcane and time-bound[20]—we deal with both treatises here.[21] The reason for this
avoidance is that Locke develops his main points through detailed engagement with his
beloved Bible. His main points may be boldly stated in the second treatise, but they are
painstakingly wrested from biblical texts in the first.[22] W
e have organized the following
analysis in terms of the main categories that have made Locke (in)famous as an early
ideologue of liberalism and capitalist market economies: freedom, reason, and self-
interest.[23] In each case, we begin with his bold claims in the second treatise, only to
track back and examine how he wrests each claim from the Bible in the first treatise. By
using this approach, the clear connections between the two treatises should become clear.
Freedom
Man has a natural freedom . . . since all that share in the same common nature, faculties, and powers, are in
nature equal, and ought to partake in the same common rights and privileges.[24]
In the second treatise, Locke formulates his battle cry for freedom: the natural state of
“men” is “a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possessions
and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature; without asking
leave, or depending upon the will of any other man.”[25] Rather pleased with his opinion,
he repeats it on not a few occasions.[26] But it does not suddenly emerge in the second
treatise, for already in the first treatise he has made the same point: “I cannot see; nor
consequently understand, how a supposition of natural freedom is a denial of Adam’s
creation.”[27] Indeed, Adam was a perfectly free being, created by God, without parents,
when “it pleased God he should.” No other conclusion is possible except that Adam
embodied the “natural freedom of mankind.”[28]
So far; so good. The natural freedom and equality[29] of human beings is of the
created order, first vested in Adam and then vouched to all who follow
. But what does
Locke mean by “all”? Does he reveal the universal by exclusion—the characteristic feature


of bourgeois freedom—that we identified with Grotius? W
e suggest he does so in three
ways, in terms of children, society, and ethnocentrism.[30] W
e discuss children first, since
society and ethnocentrism manifest the many traps that the Fall produces for Locke. W
e
are all free in our natural state, proclaims Locke, but are we born free? The answer is a
firm no: only Adam was born, or rather created, free, for he was created in the full flush of
his masculine prowess. Giving the impression that he is watching a body builder’s
posing routine, Locke gushes: “Adam was created a perfect man, his body and mind in
full possession of their strength and reason, and so was capable from the first instant of
his being to provide for his own support and preservation, and govern his actions
according to the dictates of the law of reason which God had implanted in him.”[31] Not
so babies and children, who account for the rest of the variety of the human species. Or
rather, they seem to have freedom inpotentia. As helpless babes, they are reliant upon and
subject to their parents until they reach an age—conveniently unspecified—when they
can exercise freedom.[32] Thus, they may be born free but cannot exercise that freedom
until some time later. Is this not a little too close to the advice given to slaves that they are
free in spirit (if not in Christ), and that the master is in even worse “bondage?”[33]
Freedom without actual freedom—here, the universal claim meets its first significant
restriction.
The limitation in terms of children is both sweeping and rather obvious, but the
matters of society and ethnocentrism are somewhat more complex. The ambivalent
benefits of society as well as Locke’s persistent ethnocentrism turn on his approach to the
state of nature. W
e suggest that the category of the state of nature, with its natural law
, is
not so much a production of Locke’s narrative as it is an effort to deal with the Fall. The
garden and its occupants thereby become the paradigmatic state of nature.[34] Yet, human
beings must undergo a transition from the state of nature to society, to government and
the body politic. While this distinction does not originate with Locke (think of the
nature-culture opposition or barbarism-civilization), it does become a code for this
inveterate lover of the Bible as he transitions from the Garden of Eden to the wider world.
But is the transition a matter of regress or progress? Disobedience and banishment from
the garden would suggest a downward turn, yet the Fall may also be read as a great boon.
If Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God, then the history of salvation would not have
taken place; Christ would not have come, and life on earth would have been poorer for it.
This fortuitous reading of the Fall has many layers (narrative necessity, a parable of
maturity, the serpent as the true manifestation of God), but our point, in relation to


Locke, is that he transfers this theological ambivalence over the Fall to his dealings with
the state of nature and society.
This ambivalence leads Locke to qualify freedom yet again. In their natural state, he
declares, men are free individuals. How free? Is one at liberty to exercise any and all
individual freedoms, even if chaos ensues as each person seeks to assert his or her freedom
at the expense of another’s? Frightened by nightmares of a Hobbesian hue, Locke hastily
observes that freedom is not the equivalent of license—that is, the liberty to destroy
oneself or another. So he rolls out the “law of nature” as a check on rampant freedom, the
law under which Adam first found himself. The basis of that law is reason, which
handily teaches all those free and equal beings that they should avoid harming one
another’s possessions, especially life, health, and freedom.[35] All the same, law in the state
of nature is not quite sufficient for managing the rampaging egos of natural human
beings; so Locke suggests that the role of government is to produce just and reasonable
laws for the protection of these vital possessions.[36] Adam cannot remain in his
primitive state forever, for the sophistications of society and civilization beckon. Lest
society appear a distant option for our naturally free man,[37] Locke deftly inserts society
into the garden itself: the creation of Eve begets the first society,[38] which is entered into
voluntarily. One consents to give up certain freedoms for the greater good—to foster what
is supposedly another dimension of human nature, the care for others. As in marriage, so
with government: “A man can never be obliged in conscience to submit to any power,
unless he can be satisfied who is the person who has a right to exercise that power over
him.”[39]
Initially, the transition from the state of nature to government seems to be beneficial:
the dangers of the former are overcome in the latter. Locke’s reformulation of the Fall
seems to be of a fortuitous tenor. However, a closer look reveals an undercurrent of regress
in the transition to society and governance. When human beings consent to be
governed, they must give up certain freedoms—a clear limitation of the full freedom
inherent in the state of nature. Freedom turns out not to be so universal.[40] Aware of this
problem, Locke initially suggests that the law of government merely fulfills, in a smooth
transition, the law of nature. Not quite pleased with this proposal, he argues more
strenuously that the voluntary giving up of certain freedoms is precisely for the purpose
of ensuring at least some freedoms. Even this suggestion is too weak, so he waxes
dialectical: given that no one freely makes a decision that is to his or her detriment,[41]
then the handing over of equality, liberty, and executive power functions to enhance self-
preservation, freedom, and property.[42] In this way, regress and progress, the Fall as


disaster and boon, meet face to face. Yet, Locke protests too much in his desperation to
avoid the clear shrinkage in freedom entailed by society and government.
The nature-society transition is largely a temporal one, happening in some mythical
past. Not so Locke’s ethnocentrism, for this is spatial, located in places other than
England and yet contemporaneous. That is, the state of nature exists now
, in more
primitive locales elsewhere on the globe.[43] Yet here, too, Locke is torn. On the one hand,
he would like to think that true freedoms exist only in places like his own island off that
peninsula on the western fringe of the Eurasian landmass. Clear signs of civilized life, as
also of advanced political and economic life, appear in places like Devonshire but not in
the “wild woods and uncultivated wastes of America.”[44] In Devonshire, they engage in
tillage as the basis of property, while the wild Indians of America gather nuts and apples.
Furthermore, in some exotics places, the locals are enslaved to barbaric passions,
begetting “children on purpose to fatten and eat them.”[45] On the other hand, life for our
Devonshire farmer is rather limited in terms of freedom, for he has surrendered not a few
freedoms to the government, and his children are free only in name. Is freedom then
found in the state of nature in which such people exist? At times, Locke seems to think
so. For instance, the agreements for exchange and truck, between “two men in the desert
island, mentioned by Garcilasso de la Vega, in his history of Peru; or between a Swiss
and an Indian, in the woods of America,” take place freely within the state of nature.[46]
They are not bound by the constraints of government, of one body politic—much like
Adam, who was created in the full vigor of life and freedom. Locke fails to resolve this
contradiction, opting now one way, now another. To reference our earlier discussion: the
transition from the garden may be a boon or a curse.[47]
In each case—whether children, society, or ethnocentrism —freedom becomes the
entitlement of a rather small group. Children, the civilized, and ethnic others need not
bother. The preeminent individual must wait until an unspecified adulthood, must give
up some freedoms for the sake of security of society and government, and must not be
from some barbarian backwater. Yet neither the state of nature nor social life in a body
politic seems to be granted freedom in Locke’s equivocations. Not only is freedom
limited, it is exceedingly elusive as well.
Reason
Human nature is becoming somewhat problematic in Locke’s effort at recasting. Much
the same applies to reason, although less needs to be said here since much of Locke’s


thought concerning freedom applies to reason as well (primarily from the first treatise).
As with freedom, children are not born with reason, for this arises only with maturity.
The difference is that reason is not held inpotentia at birth—it must be learnt. However,
reason poses further problems for Locke, problems that would later bedevil the creation of
the eminently reasonable homo economicus. To begin with, reason is the determining
feature of the law of nature.[48] Here, Locke faces the same contradiction we noted
regarding freedom. Is reason purer in the state of nature, until it is partially surrendered
with the shift to government? Or is it preeminently a feature of the laws of proper
government, needed to rein in the wildness of the state of nature? Once again, the
paradoxes of the Fall emerge from between the lines of Locke’s text. Furthermore, Adam
is trapped. Within the various theological traditions (as we indicated earlier), Adam is
both the exemplar of all human beings and the exception, unlike any other person. With
regard to reason, the law that governs him, the law of reason, governs all his posterity;[49]
yet, he is the only one who possesses reason from the first moment of existence, unlike
those who come after him, who must bide their time until maturity.
Despite the way that Locke champions reason—so much so that intellect is itself part
of the image of God according to which we were created[50]—he is rather wary of reason.
It can never function on its own, for it should always function alongside revelation,
especially when one is in search of truth.[51] Indeed, when it comes down to a difference
between reason and revelation, the latter wins out (Locke increasingly tended toward this
position in later life). W
e would suggest that this recourse to revelation was an effort to
deal not merely with tensions between reason and revelation, but even more so with the
irresolvable contradictions of reason itself, if not freedom. It hardly needs to be said that
revelation raises myriad problems of its own, which means that Locke’s desperate effort
at resolution only produced more problems.[52] Nonetheless, Locke’s wariness
concerning reason is rather refreshing, even if one is not persuaded by his solution. This
wariness would not afflict those who followed in Locke’s wake. Eschewing revelation as
so much old-fashioned superstition, they championed reason to produce the rather
curious notions of comparative advantage, rational choice, and that eminent misfit,
economic man.
Self-Interest
Thus far we have covered two aspects of Locke’s effort to create a new theory of human
nature. As we have seen, he cannot avoid straying into moral territory, not least because


of the contested theological nature of that terrain. Are human beings corrupted by the
Fall, or do they retain some trace of the image of God within them? For Grotius,
prevenient grace restores some (or rather, a good deal) of that image, producing free-
willing and reasoning individuals who are able to accept or resist God’s grace. As we
indicated, Locke also exhibits some Arminian tendencies, considering that his favorite
theologian was the Remonstrant, Philipp van Limborch. While Locke does not have
recourse to the theory of prevenient grace (the Fall’s only effect is to render human beings
mortal), he does take a stand for freedom, no matter how limited that freedom turns out to
be.
However, on the matter of self-interest, he is fully in agreement with Grotius. Yes, says
he, we may be driven by self-interest, but that needs to be balanced by a concern for
others. Accordingly, in the second treatise, Locke opines that if one’s own preservation is
not in question, then it is only proper to look out for others—or rather, to ensure that the
property of another is preserved, property that is defined as “life, liberty, health, limb, or
goods.”[53] Yet, his formulation in the first treatise is sharper and more obviously
theological. Self-interest may be the “first and strongest desire God implanted in men,”
which manifests itself in the desire to preserve oneself, and to ensure sufficient resources
to live. Not to be too one-sided, “God planted in men a strong desire also of propagating
their kind,” which entails the concern for one’s immediate others, the fruit of one’s loins.
[54] That the treatment of concern for both self and others should slide into the question
of property and inheritance is no accident. At an obvious level, each man is not the sole
possessor of property, for his children are entitled to it upon his death.[55] But at a deeper
level, it is worth noting that when Locke speaks of property and inheritance, he relies
heavily on the language of rights: children have a right to share the possessions of their
parents and then take them over upon their parents’ death, a right that is embodied in
both the law of God and the law of the land.[56] Yet, this close connection between
property and rights in Locke’s text should not surprise us, for Grotius had already spoken
of rights as property belonging to individuals. By Locke’s time, the two were inextricably
connected.
A Myth Retold—Again
Thus in the beginning all the world was America.[57]
All paths turn towards property, it seems. On a number of occasions, we have noted that
Locke’s thoughts slip in this direction. Indeed, the work’s real contribution lies in its


theory of property, which appears in its clearest form in the fifth chapter of the second
treatise. But it is theory in terms of story, a glorious myth that is nothing less than the
retelling and reshaping of the myth that Grotius had created some years earlier.[58] Given
its importance, we explore that myth in detail. As we have shown, the building blocks of
the myth have already been constructed in the first treatise, so we note those pieces at the
appropriate points. Not surprisingly, the Fall looms large in this myth as well, more
through Locke’s strenuous efforts to sidestep the implications of the Fall for his proposal
concerning property.
Setting the Scene
Before we sink into the myth and analyze its workings, we need to set the scene by way
of two other texts by Locke—The Reasonableness of Christianity and a recently published
note called “Homo ante et post Lapsum” (Man Before and After the Fall).[59] In both
texts, Locke deals directly with the Fall. While the former was published in his lifetime
(albeit anonymously), the other remained unpublished, a private reflection that manifests
some doubts about his published opinions. W
e begin with the text from Reasonableness,
for it clears the interpretive path for the myth he seeks to construct in the second treatise.
The basic story of Genesis 3 is known well enough: the garden, the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, the serpent, Eve and then Adam eating from the tree, the
punishments. Of these, the punishments are the most important (Gen. 3:14-19). Two
curses each are handed out to the serpent, woman, and man—six in total. The serpent is
cursed to move on its belly and to be in constant enmity with the woman’s posterity. The
woman is to have pain in childbirth and be ruled over by her man. The man is
condemned to work for food, wresting it from a resistant and weed-infested soil, and
eventually to die. Or, as the text puts it:
Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it
shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat
bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall
return (Gen. 3:17-19 NRSV).
Let us examine what Locke does with this text. He opens Reasonableness with a treatment
of the Fall, seeking a path between those (Calvinists) who saw in Adam’s sin the
complete condemnation of all human beings (if not the whole of nature) and those who
regarded it as but a trifle (Deists). Not too much and not too little, for Christ did need to
redeem us from at least some evil. So what did Adam bring about through his act of


disobedience? Quite simply, “the doctrine of the gospel is, that death came on all men by
Adam’s sin.”[60] Tellingly, Locke draws this conclusion not from Gen. 3:19, but from
other texts. Thus, he quotes the earlier words of God concerning the tree: “In the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”[61]He then glosses over the reason given for the
banishment from paradise: “Lest he should take thereof and live for ever”.[62] When
several texts are added from Romans mentioning Adam’s inauguration of death (Rom.
5:12; 15:22), the conclusion is, for Locke at least, clear. Paradise was thereby the realm of
immortality, but the disobedience of Adam led to banishment and death. But what does
Locke mean by death? Adam does not die immediately; rather, he has been sentenced. He
bides his time until the execution of the sentence. In this way, death has showed its face.
However, death is very much the ontological state rather than the mere physical reality of
the cessation of life: “I must confess by Death here we can understand nothing but a
ceasing to be, the losing of all actions of life and sense.”[63]
All the same, Locke is too careful a reader of the Bible not to deal with Gen. 3:17-19.
How he does so is significant. After quoting the verses, he writes:
This shews that paradise was a place of bliss as well as immortality, without toyl, and without sorrow. But
when man was turned out, he was exposed to the drudgery, anxiety, and frailties of this mortal life, which
should end in the dust, out of which he was made, and to which he should return; and then have no more
life or sense than the dust had, out of which he was made.[64]
This interpretation is extraordinary both for its brevity and for what it elides. Apart from
the obvious point that no mention is made of the serpent or of the woman,[65] Locke is
keen to emphasize mortality. In doing so, the obvious reference to labor becomes the
“drudgery, anxiety, and frailties of this mortal life.” The King James Version he uses
translates ‘iṣṣābôn as “sorrow
,”[66] but the mention of the “sweat of thy face” can hardly be
avoided. Yet avoid it Locke does. The absence of labor in paradise becomes a sign of
bliss, where one does not toil or suffer sorrow
. Therefore, banishment means death and
the loss of that bliss, which brings the trials and troubles of mortal life. Of all the curses
in Genesis 3, only the last (hard labor and death) actually counts for Locke.
At this point, the recently published note, “Homo ante et post Lapsum,” becomes
important.[67] It too is a reflection on the curses after the Fall, and it too begins by
stressing that the primary curse was death. Put another way: the curse is now that Adam
is unable to eat from the tree of life. Man may have been born mortal, but that tree would
have enabled him to be clothed in immortality. But he sinned and was banished from the
garden where the tree grew
. Next, we come across this passage:
Upon their offence they were afraid of God: this gave them frightful ideas and apprehensions of him and


that lessened their love, which turned their minds to that nature, for this root of all evil in them made
impressions and so infected their children, and when private possessions and labour, which now the curse
on the earth made necessary, by degrees made a distinction of conditions, it gave room for covetousness,
pride, and ambition, which by fashion and example spread the corruption which has so prevailed over
mankind.[68]
Private possessions and labor are the direct result of the curse of the earth. Social
distinctions follow
, with some people becoming richer and others poorer. These
conditions lead to pride, ambition, corruption, not to mention evil that infects the
children of the first parents. Clearly, Locke was aware of the other curses, so much so that
in this note he states that labor and private possessions were outcomes of the Fall. Had he
taken this line in the myth we analyze later, it would have been a very different myth
indeed. It is telling, therefore, that the only place in Locke’s written works where he
entertains this rather obvious interpretation of the Fall is found in an unpublished note.
The fact that it remained buried in his archives unpublished until a few years ago may be
read as an allegory of his effort to bury that interpretation in his published work. It
certainly does not appear in the interpretation of the Fall in Reasonableness, and it is far
removed from his grand myth of the origins of property and labor.
To return to Reasonableness: the only outcome of the Fall that Adam passed onto his
posterity is death. All of us remain banished from the garden, from the state of
immortality and bliss. And so Christ’s redemption overcomes that death, leading to
resurrection and immortality. What then of sin? Adam did not pass on the guilt of sin,
for that would involve removing responsibility and culpability for sin, thereby
compromising the justice and goodness of God. Instead, each person bears the
responsibility for his or her own sins and must account for them at the judgment seat.[69]
This kind of interpretive narrowing—that is, focusing on death as the result of the
Fall—leaves Locke plenty of room for his alternative myth. Now that the curse of labor
and toil has been airbrushed from the account in Genesis 3, Locke is free to recast labor
in his own way. Thus, even in paradise we encounter labor and private property, which
naturally follow on from the commandment to subdue the earth. Or rather, the myth in
the Two Treatises and the interpretation of the Fall in Reasonableness fit together rather
neatly. The biblical interpretation may open up space for the myth, but the myth also
determines how the Fall may be understood.
The Commons
With this license to rewrite, Locke is able to construct his myth. Using a simple narrative


sequence, he echoes Grotius in many instances: common property; labor and then use as
the basis of private property, initially with food; the need for government to protect
private property, which covers everything pertaining to human life, if not that life itself.
Locke begins by posing a problem he seeks to solve by the use of both reason and
revelation:
It is very clear, that God, as king David says, Psal. cvx. 16, “has given the earth to the children of men;”
given it to mankind in common. But this being supposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty how any
one should ever come to have a property in any thing . . . I shall endeavour to show how men might come
to have a property in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that without any
express compact of all the commoners.[70]
How did private property arise if the created order was one of property in common, if
God’s original gift was common property? Locke immediately rules out any “express
compact” that may have given rise to private property, so he must find another answer.
Before addressing his answer, we would like to note how Locke arrives at the initial
proposal of common property, not in the myth itself but in the first treatise. The biblical
text in question is Gen. 1:28: “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, ‘Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of
the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the
earth.’” For Locke, the plural object of the opening sentence is telling. God spoke to and
blessed “them,” not “him” (Adam). Thus, “it was not a private dominion, but a dominion
in common with the rest of mankind.”[71] As with Noah and his sons after the flood,[72]
the gift from God—the ultimate owner of all—was an original community with all
things in common among human beings.[73]
Use and Appropriation
Up to this point, we have property in common but not yet private property. In order to
account for that step in his myth, Locke rolls out the old idea of use: “God, who hath
given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the
best advantage of life and convenience.”[74] More specifically, it is use for sustenance, for
food. Not surprisingly, both points—use in general, and use in particular, for food and
raiment—appear in the first treatise.[75] So far, Locke follows in Grotius’s footsteps, but
now his narrative veers in another direction. Grotius, at this point in his reasoning, had
introduced a sleight of hand. He argues that the ingestion of food provided the first


instance of private property and concludes that all other property is similar in kind.
Locke avoids this deceptive piece of logic, only to insert another. He asks:
He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in
the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. Nobody can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask
then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or when he ate? or when he boiled? or when he
brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his,
nothing else could.[76]
When exactly does an item of food become private property? The initial movement of
picking a piece of fruit removes it from the common pool and makes it one’s own
property. In other words, use has a prerequisite—namely, the moment of appropriation.[77]
The moment when Eve takes the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
immediately comes to mind. By that act, she made the fruit her own. Locke dare not use
this example, for it would introduce too many complications. He prefers an alternative to
Adam and Eve—the “wild Indian,” who takes fruit and venison from the common pool
before it can benefit him. (Throughout the myth, “Indian” serves as code for Adam.)[78]
This replacement of the Garden of Eden with “America” soon becomes a standard motif
in Locke’s myth, so much so that at one point, he exclaims, “Thus in the beginning all
the world was America.”[79] Thereby, Locke makes his own distinct contribution to the
myth of the Trans-Atlantic Eden and, in the process, avoids some of the more prickly
parts of the story—in particular, the fact that Adam and Eve were permitted to eat the flora
of the garden but not the animals (Gen. 1:29; 2:16). That permission was granted only to
Noah (Gen. 9:3). Locke’s “wild Indian” can do both.
Labor
W
e mentioned earlier that Locke’s move to define private property as an appropriation
from the commons constitutes a sleight of hand—or, rather, a sleight of interpretation, for
it locates the first act that marks private property in the garden itself, before the Fall.
Private property has, in other words, been smuggled into the garden. The importance of
this furtive act becomes clear in the next segment of the myth:
Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own
person: this nobody has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may
say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in,
he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.
[80]
Not everything is held in common at the moment of creation! A man’s person is already


his own property, which means that his labor is also his own. Therefore, if he picks a
piece of fruit or a wild vegetable, he has engaged in labor. Once he has done so, the item
picked mysteriously attains the same status as that labor, without requiring consent from
anyone else. Locke struggles to find the terminology to express this transformation: it
may be like a magical potion or an infection (“mixed with”); or perhaps arithmetic, in
which private property is “added to” the piece of fruit; or perhaps it is “annexed” or
“joined to,” like a piece of territory that has been conquered.[81] In all this, the somewhat
mystifying nature of labor as private property is clearly stronger than common property;
everything labor touches turns to private property. Despite the importance of this point,
Locke provides no coherent reasons apart from the assertion that labor is “unquestionable
property.” Why is labor private property? Why can it not be common property as well? If
it is private, why does labor not become common when it comes into contact with the
piece of fruit? Macpherson astutely identifies the reason why Locke asserts that labor is
private property: it means that “his labour, and its productivity, is something for which
he owes no debt to society.”[82] As we see in a moment, resorting to labor as private
property—given and commanded by God—reinforces this assertion. Even so, it is highly
questionable that reaching out and picking a piece of fruit constitutes labor. If this is the
case, any movement of the human body is also labor – walking, sitting, snoring, or
defecating. Does the earth walked upon, the log sat upon, the air snored in, or even the
hole into which feces drops, become private property?
These problems conceal the most significant feature of Locke’s proposal: he has
smuggled yet another item into the garden. In the story of Genesis 3, labor is clearly the
result of the curse given to the man: “Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you
shall eat of it all the days of your life” (Gen. 3:17). In the garden there was no toil, no
labor, for everything was provided; outside the garden, life abounds with hard labor. As
we suggested earlier, Locke negates this reading of the Fall by arguing (in The
Reasonableness of Christianity) that the initial act of disobedience resulted only in death as
a punishment; the other curses seem to have been neutralized.[83] Now Locke can sneak
labor surreptitiously into the garden, perhaps while the angel at the gate is distracted,
lighting a cigarette with his flaming sword. As if to justify his dabbling in the black
market, Locke strenuously asserts, especially in the first treatise, that these matters were
divinely ordained. God created human beings with the natural desire to care for
themselves; in order to do so, they needed to appropriate and use what God had created.
It follows that God, too, had ordained private property: by the “will and grant of God . . .
man’s property in the creatures was founded upon the right he had to make use of those


things that were necessary or useful to his being.”[84] It would not be the first time
someone has called upon God to justify a dubious position. The advantage for Locke’s
own myth is that it means labor is of the created order, but the disadvantage is that he has
not as yet faced up to the Fall. It will continue to trip him up.
Locke’s path to this point may be somewhat different from Grotius’s, but the result is
the same. Once Locke has told his story of the paradigmatic process of private property,
he can extend it to just about everything. It may be “the grass my horse has bit; the turfs
my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place”;[85] it may be the pitcher of
water I have drawn from the fountain;[86] or it may be the fish from the ocean, the
ambergris from a whale’s digestive system (once used for perfume), or the deer caught in
the hunt.[87] No consent from others is required, for this is both a supposedly obvious
process, and—as if to shore up what may not be so obvious after all—one ordained by
God when he created human beings and gave them the nature they have.
Nonetheless, with this collection of examples, Locke has moved from the state of
nature to that of government with its laws. His initial suggestion is that much still
remains in the commons, such as oceans and forests. Thereby, we witness the process of
appropriation through labor in our own day. But he also slips in a crucial sentence: “And
amongst those who are counted the civilized part of mankind, who have made and
multiplied positive laws to determine property, this original law of nature, for the
beginning of property, in what was before common, still takes place.”[88] At first read,
Locke seems to be speaking of the survivals of commons and of the original process of
property. A second look at the sentence reveals an assumption of continuity. The
beginning of property is, for Locke, an original law of nature, which unfolds smoothly
into the civilized laws of “mankind”—laws that add more laws concerning property. It
appears that original law has found its true home amongst the myriad laws of property in
his own day. Innocent enough—or at least it appears to be so.
However, the Fall rears its head once again, precisely through Locke’s deft efforts to
sidestep it. Since he has smuggled labor and private property into the garden before the
Fall (the state of nature) and thereby made them basic to human nature, it follows that
subsequent laws concerning property are simply an unfolding of this original law
. The
passage from one to the other is smooth rather than bumpy, untroubled rather than beset
with curses and banishments. It is as though Adam (signaled once again by the “Indian”)
has strolled out of the garden, taking with him his labor and property, with the fond
farewells from God and the muscled bouncer at gate still ringing in his ears.


Tilling the Earth
With this comfortable transition established, Locke can tackle the more contentious issue
of tilling the earth:
But the chief matter of property being now not the fruits of the earth, and the beasts that subsist on it, but
the earth itself; as that which takes in, and carries with it all the rest; I think it is plain, that property in that
too is acquired as the former. As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the
product of, so much is his property. He by his labour does, as it were, enclose it from the common . . . God,
when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour, and the penury of his
condition required it of him. God and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, i.e. improve it for the
benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was his own, his labour. He that, in obedience to
this command of God, subdued, tilled, and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it something that was
his property, which another had no title to, nor could without injury take from him.[89]
Initially, Locke extends his earlier argument to include land, for it also becomes private
property through labor, which then produces what can be of use.[90] Land, too, is drawn
from the common, although here Locke compares this process with the long and
contentious history of enclosures in England and the rest of W
estern Europe. Through
this comparison, Locke implicitly connects the primal man with the landlord rather than
the peasant, who is banished from the land so enclosed. However, the most significant
moment in this text is the linking of Gen 1:28 and Gen. 3:17-19. While the former
speaks of subduing the earth and having dominion over it, the latter concerns labor and
the sweat of one’s brow in tilling a recalcitrant earth for crops and bread. By comparison,
note Locke’s formulations, which proceed in three stages. Initially, the man “tills, plants,
improves, cultivates.” He is in his post-lapsarian state, banished from the garden and
working himself to the bone. Next, Locke suddenly realizes the implication of what he
has written, for he mentions labor as the “penury of his condition.” Now he is in
dangerous territory: according to Gen. 3:17-19, labor—and therefore private property—
must be the result of the Fall, a punishment for sin. But Locke catches himself and
immediately includes a direct reference to Gen. 1:28, in which God commands man to
“subdue the earth.” In case the term subdue is at all unclear, Locke explains: it means
engaging in labor to improve the earth for one’s own property and benefit. A
momentous move, this distinction makes the labor of tilling the ground a natural result
of subduing the earth. In other words, Gen. 3:17-19 is merely a logical outcome of Gen.
1:28. The Fall has almost tripped Locke up at this point, but he regains his feet and skips
past it yet again. Finally, he has found a way to connect the two items in one list: the
man has “subdued, tilled and sowed,” and any piece of earth so worked becomes his
private property.[91] Even more stunning is Locke’s assertion that this is “in obedience to


this command of God.” Not disobedience that leads to agricultural labor, but obedience
to the command to subdue results in private property. The Fall has been effaced once
more.[92]
Adam and the Plot Lines of the Fall
Private property is therefore the will of God! Locke sums up: Although “God gave the
world to men in common,” he cannot have meant it to remain so since it was for the
benefit of “man.” Therefore, God “gave it to the use of the industrious and rational (and
labour was to be his title to it).”[93] Here, two problems arise, both of Locke’s own
making: the role of Adam and the tensions between plot lines. As for Adam, the
implication of the whole story until now is that Adam too is one who labors, thereby
acquiring private property and the title of landholder. If his very act of reaching out to
take some fruit or grain is defined as work, then he, too, possesses private property. If he
follows God’s command to subdue the earth—given in the garden—then he too is a tiller
of the soil. Locke seems to be aware of the problem, for the commons begin to dissolve in
the primal act of private property. W
as Adam then given private dominion and property
at creation, especially since his person and labor were already his own? Belatedly, Locke
reasserts his narrative opening: “And thus, without supposing any private dominion and
property in Adam, over all the world, exclusive of all other men, which can no way be
proved, nor any one’s property be made out from it; but supposing the world given, as it
was, to the children of men in common.”[94] Only after Adam did human beings,
through labor, make parcels of land their property.[95] Of course, myths are not meant to
be watertight, for they manifest contradictions in their very efforts to resolve them.[96]
But this assertion adds a sufficiently jarring note to the story thus far.
Second, Locke plays with three different plot lines in his strenuous efforts to counter
the implications of the Fall: the path from commons to private property is either one of
smooth continuity, of degradation, or of improvement.[97] Locke entertains the first
possibility in his suggestion that private property was the result of obeying God’s
command, already in the garden, to subdue the earth. The second appears earlier in the
treatment of freedom, in which those in the state of nature seem to have greater freedom
than those in bodies politic. In this same discussion, the third plot line—which stresses
improvement—also makes an appearance, particularly in terms of the suggestion that
freedoms and property are enhanced under government. At this point in the myth, Locke
makes a similar effort. A man who appropriates land from the common and cultivates it


actually increases the value of the common. Consider again, Locke suggests, indigenous
peoples (with America plainly in mind) who have little idea how to cultivate, for all they
do is gather fruits and hunt venison. Now compare our old friend, the Devonshire farmer,
who improves his land and produces much higher yields. At a minimum, he might gain
from ten acres what the wild native gains from one hundred. That leaves ninety more
acres still in the common for others to acquire, labor upon, and use.[98] Once again,
glimpses of the fortuitous Fall peek out from behind Locke’s story: the Fall benefits
everyone, he suggests, not merely the one who seized land for himself. A better apologia
for the long pattern of enclosures in W
estern Europe could not have been written.
The clear improvement provided by labor and private property remains the dominant
plot line for most of the remainder of the myth. Locke waxes forth about the benefits of
labor, offering extended comparisons with the poor natives of America and the
industrious English farmers. Labor, he asserts, adds value to the land worked—not in a
ratio of one to ten, but of one to ninety-nine hundreds. Bread is clearly better than
acorns; wine far preferable to water; cloth or silk more desirable than skins, moss, or
leaves (surely a reference to apocryphal stories of Adam and Eve clothing themselves with
leaves). Indeed, one can only wonder at the amount of labor that goes into a loaf of bread:
It is not barely the ploughman’s pains, the reaper’s and thresher’s toil, and the baker’s sweat, is to be counted
into the bread we eat;[99] the labour of those who broke the oxen, who digged and wrought the iron and
stones, who felled and framed the timber employed about the plough, mill, oven, or any other utensils,
which are a vast number, requisite to this corn, from its being seed to be sown to its being made bread,
must all be charged on the account of labour.”[100]
Smitten by the wonder of such a process, Locke asserts that what is produced by nature—
in the realm of the commons—is well-nigh worthless. Of course, if only labor produces
value, then the earth and its products are valueless. Needless to say, the lives of those who
labor are immeasurably greater than those in the state of nature, who merely rely upon a
valueless earth for their sustenance. Those poor American indigenes simply have no
idea, so much so that “a king of a large and fruitful territory there feeds, lodges, and is
clad worse than a day-labourer in England.”[101] The Garden of Eden has begun to look
like a decidedly undesirable place.
Downcast Ending
The remainder of the myth passes rather quickly through the gathering together of
communities into territories, the development of industry, states and their positive laws


for the protection of property,[102] leagues of states, and finally, money—that great
imperishable, which leads to commerce and greater expansion of property (albeit through
a necessarily unequal distribution of the earth).[103] A rousing finale, is it not, with
which to end such a grand myth? But Locke does not end here. He adds a curious
qualification, one that he has already repeated in various forms throughout the myth.
Initially, he repeats the main point that labor produces property out of the common
things of nature. But then he adds:
So that there could then be no reason of quarrelling about title, nor any doubt about the largeness of
possession it gave. Right and conveniency went together; for as a man had a right to all he could employ his
labour upon, so he had no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of. This left no room for
controversy about the title, nor for encroachment on the right of others; what portion a man carved to
himself was easily seen: and it was useless, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than
he needed.[104]
Dishonesty, greed, encroachment, excessive acquisition – these produce a sober and
downcast tone at the close. A glorious, triumphant myth he spins no longer.[105] W
e
would suggest that two traces of the banished Fall recur in this curious ending. The first
concerns the obsessive repetition of his concern over excessive appropriation.[106] Early
on in the myth, Locke feels he must deal with the unwelcome implication of his
suggestion that property involves, through a simple act of labor, the appropriation of
items from the natural commons. How does one prevent someone from taking too
much, beyond the needs of everyday subsistence? His answer alludes to the story of
manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), in which some of the people took more than they
needed—so much so that it rotted and bred worms. The same is true with fruit and grains
and venison: if it spoils, too much has been taken. In the case of land, not much is needed
to provide for the necessities of life. Take only what is necessary; this, too, is a law of
nature (and a biblical command). Again and again, Locke returns to this problem, nearly
always mentioning the rotting and spoiling of the excess—fruit, meat, even the pasture
on excess land can perish.[107] Why repeat this point? On one level, he is keen to block an
obvious implication of his story. But at another, formal level, we would suggest that this
pattern betrays his failed effort to resolve precisely what he wants to do with the Fall.
Does it count at all in the untrammeled passage from Adam to all human beings? Does it
actually mean a boon for the whole earth, giving rise to labor, property, value, states,
money, and commerce? Or is there a darker note, the one on which the story ends? With
that ending dwelling on rampant greed, encroachment, and dishonesty, the Fall seems to
have had the last word.


Conclusion: On Human Nature and Biblical Limitations
God hath woven into the principles of human nature.[108]
W
e have emphasized that the central biblical text upon which Locke’s myth of property
constantly threatens to dash itself is that of Genesis 1–3. Clearly, we have focused on this
myth because of its direct economic concerns. However, this particular myth is but one
element—albeit a crucial one—within the larger context of the two treatises. For this
reason, we explored the ways in which Adam provides Locke with his positions on
freedom, reason, and self-interest, positions developed in the specific debates of the first
treatise and then elaborated upon in the second. Ultimately, Locke’s concentration on
Adam is due to Locke’s obsessions concerning human nature. Since Adam was, for
Locke and so many others at the time, the first human being created by God, his nature
becomes the paradigm for all human nature. The paradox is that the intense debates over
human nature, the search for its essence, actually indicate profound changes in human
nature itself. The search for an eternal nature was a response to, and thereby an indication
of, the way capitalism was reshaping what it meant to be human. The means and
relations of production so distinctive to capitalism had already begun and would
continue to produce such a shift.[109] Of course, the dialectical point to be made is that
human beings create new modes of production, so the changes in human nature are the
products of human activity. As for Locke and his contemporaries, they were, perhaps,
more aware of the changes being wrought, unlike our own situation, in which
capitalism seems like an untranscendable horizon beyond which it becomes difficult to
imagine any other reality. And so they argued over that human nature: what is the true
nature of human beings? Are they free or not? Are they rational or passionate? Are they
self-interested or concerned for others? Is agricultural labor the natural task of “man”?
And is that labor, if not his body and its freedom, his personal property?
One of the clearest, albeit unexpected, symptoms of that shift appears in Locke’s
biblical interpretation. He sought to reinterpret the accounts of Adam and the Fall in a
way that would justify a new theory of human nature. Are human beings enslaved to a
sinful nature and condemned to hard labor in the fields as a result? Or are they free and
equal, with labor as personal property that turns all it touches into private property? God
may have created a world in which there was no private property, in which all was held in
common, but he also created industrious Englishmen, ready to work hard. He
commanded them to subdue the earth, which means working, tilling, and improving
the soil. That is, he created a mechanism for the appropriation of private property from


that commons. Obviously, this interpretation requires a drastic rereading of the Fall,
which is evident in our detailed analysis of Locke’s myth. But just as obvious is the way
he reinterprets the Fall in The Reasonableness of Christianity, where only the curse
concerning death has any teeth. From dust you have come and to dust you shall return—
nothing more. With the result of the Fall narrowed down in such a fashion, Locke gives
himself plenty of room to reinterpret the remainder of the narrative, to the extent that
labor, appropriation, and private property are not merely prelapsarian, but actually
untouched by the Fall. Yet, despite Locke’s best efforts, the resolution is not quite so easy.
At various points, the banished Fall troubles his myth: in the equivocation concerning
the plot line from the state of nature to civilized government; in the obsessive repetition
of his worry that people may appropriate too much; and in the oddly downcast note with
which the myth closes.
Throughout these struggles, Locke assumes that human nature is eternal, as God had
created it. So he sought long and hard in the biblical texts concerning that first created
being for an idea of that eternal essence. The problem is that the conclusions he reaches
are highly specific. The human in question was a man in a colonial country, ethnically
distinct from those in peripheral zones (“America” and elsewhere), and, above all, a man
being reshaped by the web of capitalist economic social relations everywhere more
apparent. Locke’s designation of the “Devonshire” farmer or day-laborer is no accident,
for this throws into sharp relief the very particular form of human nature in Locke’s
purview
. W
e suggest that the particularity of Locke’s idea of human nature is signaled by
his resolute biblical focus. This should not be seen as a relic of a more religious age, in
which the Bible and differences concerning it determined every aspect of life in a place
like England, if not Europe as whole. According to this line of argument, later economic
theorists would shed these rather quaint and external concerns in order to get on with the
real issues at stake. Instead, we argue that the ubiquitous nature of the Bible and its
interpretation reveals the specific situation in which that economic theory arose. Without
the Bible, the theory could not arise; indeed, it needed these engagements to emerge at
all. Thus, when it became fashionable a little later to dispense with biblical engagement, it
seemed possible to efface the particularity of that theory and assert its universality. Adam
Smith certainly tried to do so, but in the process, he accentuated Locke’s ethnocentrism.

of liberalism, Parker promotes Locke as an egalitarian thinker and conveniently excludes Locke’s
ethnocentrism (especially his characterization of North American indigenous peoples) and ruling class
location, a fact that becomes clear when one focuses on his economic thought.

misleading list of conclusions: Adam had no dominion over his children or over the world and neither did his
heirs. Moreover, the heir could not be easily determined, and even if it could, the line has been lost. Locke,

oleration, 2.1. (References provide the treatise number

reatises and the respective numbered paragraph.)
21. The catalyst for the writing of the treatises was Robert Filmer’s attempt to find an argument for absolute
monarchy in the first chapter of Genesis rather than in 1 Kgs. 9:1-9 (God’s promise to Solomon) or 1 Sam. 8-
10, where earlier justifications had been found. Since Genesis marks the beginning of the world and human
existence, Filmer sought to show that God created the first man as an absolute monarch (with dominion and
paternity), making it possible for despots with unhealthily high opinions of themselves to claim that their
authority originated in the created order. This argument was appealing at the time largely due to the recent
turmoil of civil war (1640s), the experience of the Puritan Revolution (1649–58), the restoration of the
monarchy in 1660, the radicalization of politics in the 1680s, and the so-called “Glorious Revolution” (the
invasion by Holland’s William III) in 1688. Tired of these disruptions, some preachers were keen to take up
Filmer’s arguments as a way to return to some semblance of order. Filmer located the cause of much of this
disruption in the dangerous thinking of people like Grotius, Milton, and Hobbes, because they threatened
his patriarchal political system from a contractarian position. For Filmer, Gen. 1:28 provided evidence that the
first form of government was monarchical, making political society natural and revealed by God.
Furthermore, property was a private matter, for God gave the whole world to Adam. Thus, everything
belonged to the sovereign, and only the sovereign had the power to grant or take away property. Locke
disagreed and set out to show that the biblical texts supported none of Filmer’s loose conclusions. Filmer,
Patriarcha and Other Political W
orks. See also Parker, The Biblical Politics of John Locke, 80–92, 103–19; Peter
Laslett, Introduction to Locke: T
wo T
reatises of Government, 3–126, ed. Peter Laslett (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1988), 67–79, 93–103.
22. Most of the references come from Genesis, especially its early chapters, and not without some discussion of
specific Hebrew and Septuagint Greek words. The reader also encounters other texts from Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Proverbs, Ezekiel, Matthew, and Ephesians, among others. Apart from
Adam (and very occasionally Eve), the work overflows with biblical characters. We meet Cain and Abel, Noah
and his sons, Nimrod, Abraham and various offspring, Moses, David, Solomon, and many more. In short,
when we enter the two treatises, we enter the world of the Bible relocated in England of the late-seventeenth
century. All this makes the argument of Strauss rather specious. Strauss suggests that Locke wants to subvert
the Bible’s political teachings and that he falsifies biblical texts to prove the sufficiency of reason over
revelation. Leo Strauss, Natural Right and History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), 207. See
also Michael P
. Zuckert, Natural Rights and the New Republicanism (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1994); Michael P
. Zuckert, Launching Liberalism (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2002).
23. In his introduction to the two treatises, Laslett discusses this image of Locke. Laslett, Introduction to Locke:
T
wo T
reatises of Government 42–44, 106–107.

right over that in another.” Ibid., II.33, 52.
26. “The freedom then of man, and liberty of acting according to his own will, is grounded on his having
reason, which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himself by, and make him know how far he is
left to the freedom of his own will.” Ibid., 2.63; see also 2.6; 2.61.

28. Ibid., 1.13; 1.14.
29. Ibid., 1.51.
30. Parker is seduced by the liberal slogan of freedom for everyone, even for the women that Locke systematically
excludes. Parker, The Biblical Politics of John Locke, 101, 111–12, 178–79, fn. 27. Waldron’s painful effort to
“disprove” Pateman, MacPherson, and others, reveals despite his efforts the fact that Locke’s range of persons
included within “freedom” was rather small. Waldron’s proposals are twofold: first, establish that Locke held a
position on human equality on theological grounds; second, show that this commitment to basic equality is
an important working premise of his entire political theory and that its influence is pervasive in his
arguments concerning property, family, slavery, government, politics, and toleration. He spectacularly fails to
show that Locke does not denigrate women, criminals, Native Americans, slaves, Roman Catholics, and
atheists (including Muslims). His argument runs aground with admissions such as, “I wish this [i.e., a
difference in authority stemming from a difference in the capacities of human beings] wasn’t what Locke
said and meant: it would make my life easier as an exponent of his theory of basic equality. But there is no
way round it.” Jeremy Waldron, God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations of Locke’s Political Thought
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 32. For those who show tellingly that the “all” is limited in
terms of gender, race, and class, see Pateman, The Sexual Contract; Charles W
. Mills, The Racial Contract
(Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1997); Macpherson, The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes
to Locke. Our focus on children, society, and ethnocentrism may be seen as additions to those arguments.
31. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.56.
32. Ibid., 2.55–57; 2.61.
33. Although at times Locke admits that slavery may happen, with war captives for instance, he generally and
rather strenuously refuses the obvious logic of Grotius, in which freedom as a property may be surrendered
voluntarily. For Locke, subservience does not entail slavery. This forces him to undertake some swift-footed
exegesis of the numerous biblical texts where slavery appears. Ibid., 1.30; 1.43; 1.56; 2.23–24; 2.85. See
Waldron, God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations of Locke’s Political Thought, ch. 7, for examples of
Locke’s swift-footed exegesis.
34. “Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge
between them, is properly the state of nature.” Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning
T
oleration, 2.19.
35. Ibid., 2.6.
36. “If man in the state of nature be so free as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and
possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to nobody, why will he part with his freedom, why will he give
up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious
to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain,
and constantly exposed to the invasion of others; for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and
the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is
very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears
and continual dangers: and it is not without reason that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with
others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties,
and estates, which I call by the general name property.” Ibid., 2.123; see also 2.127.


37. In the canonical narrative of the Bible, it is quite some time before an actual state and government appear –
perhaps in the wilderness wanderings of Exodus through to Deuteronomy, but definitely with the judges
and the kings after the mythical conquest of Canaan.
38. As we show later, Locke repeats this move on a number of occasions, smuggling items into the garden that
actually appear outside it. These include private property and labor.
39. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 1.81. Plenty of statements to this effect
appear in the second treatise, but the text we have quoted actually comes from the first. Ibid., 2.11; 2.15;
2.87; 2.95. Consent to government is a major theme in the myth concerning the rise of politics. Ibid., 2.101–
112.
40. Macpherson is particularly useful here, pointing out that Locke in many ways expressed the ambivalence of
emerging bourgeois society, which simultaneously demanded formal equality and freedom while requiring a
substantive inequality and lack of freedom. Macpherson, The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism:
Hobbes to Locke, 238–57, 261–62.
41. In other words, human beings always act for their own advantage. This slogan will come into its own with
Adam Smith and David Ricardo, although Locke is still guarded (see below). He seems to be aware that
human beings more often opt for the worst rather than the best, degrading their own condition in the ill-
fated belief that it may improve or even knowing full well that it is to their detriment.
42. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.131.
43. This ethnocentrism functions as another signal of the specificity of classical economic theory, a specificity we
discuss in full in relation to Adam Smith.
44. Locke, T

oleration, 2.37.
45. Ibid., 1.57.
46. Ibid., 2.14.
47. In his study of racial and state theory, Goldberg argues that Charles Mills has misunderstood Locke as
naturalizing the indigenous populations of Africa and North America and condemning both to an eternal
state of nature. Goldberg sees Hobbes as espousing such a position but understands Locke as advocating a
historicist position, which he sees as much more in line with Locke’s anti-essentialism. Such a position entails
that Native Americans and Africans, like children, are not yet historically ready for the self-rule enabled by
contractual states. David Theo Goldberg, The Racial State (London: Blackwell, 2002), 43–44.
48. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.19.
49. Ibid., 1.57.
50. Ibid., 1.30.
51. Ibid., 1.60. For a full treatment of the limitations of reason in relation to revelation, see book 4 of John
Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. Peter H. Nidditch (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania State
University Press, 1999 [1690]), 515–718. See also Parker, The Biblical Politics of John Locke, 38–45. Waldron is
seriously mistaken in his assertion that, for Locke, revelation and reason are basically equivalent. Jeremy
Waldron, The Right to Private Property (Oxford: Clarendon, 1988), 143.
52. Robert E. Brown offers a different emphasis and a good discussion of the problem of “revelation and reason”
in “Edwards, Locke, and the Bible,” The Journal of Religion 79, no. 3 (1999): 361–384, 366–70. The article
deals with the reception of Locke in the work of Jonathan Edwards.
53. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.6.
54. Ibid., 1.88; see also 1.42; 1.56.
55. Note especially, in relation to the commandment to honor one’s parents: “For we are not now speaking of
that reverence, acknowledgment, respect, and honour, that is always due from children to their parents; but
of possessions and commodities of life valuable by money.” Ibid., 1.90.
56. Ibid., 1.88.
57. Ibid., 2.49.


58. A comparable myth concerning the origin of government and states (beyond our concern with economics),
which includes a means to overcome the inconveniences of the state of nature, may be found in Locke, T
wo
T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.101–112. Although we have learned much from
Macpherson’s reading of Locke, he misses the crucial role of Locke’s wrestling with the Bible, as well as the
mythical nature of Locke’s proposal. Waldron also miss the mythmaking here, preferring to see it as a series of
philosophical propositions. Macpherson, The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke, 197–
221; Waldron, The Right to Private Property, 137–252.
59. Locke, The Reasonableness of Christianity: As Delivered in the Scriptures, 320–21; John Locke, Political Essays,

207.
61. Ibid., 6, quoting from  Gen. 2:17. He glosses the same text on the next page: “That in the day that thou eatest
of the forbidden Fruit, thou shalt die.” Ibid., 7.
62. Ibid., 6, glossing Gen. 3:22.
63. Ibid., 8.
64. Ibid., 9.
65. In the first treatise, the curse given to Eve is mentioned, but only to make the point (against Robert Filmer)
that it means Adam had “accidentally a superiority over her.” Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter
Concerning T
oleration, 1.44.
66. The root is ‘ṣb, with the sense of pain and toil.
67. Parker also gives some attention to this text. While noting the emphasis on mortality, he misses the crucial
point concerning labor and property. Parker, The Biblical Politics of John Locke, 59–61.
68. Locke, Political Essays, 321.
69. In “A Third Letter for Toleration,” Locke raises doubts concerning the doctrine of original sin: “The
doctrine of original sin, is that which is professed and must be owned by the members of the church of
England, as is evident from the XXXIX articles, and several passages in the liturgy: and yet I ask you,
whether this be ‘so obvious and exposed to all that diligently and sincerely seek the truth,’ that one who is in
the communion of the church of England, sincerely seeking the truth, may not raise to himself such
difficulties, concerning the doctrine of original sin, as may puzzle him though he be a man of study; and
whether he may not push his inquiries so far, as to be staggered in his opinion?” John Locke, “A Third Letter
for Toleration: To the Author of the Third Letter Concerning Toleration,” in The W
orks of John Locke, vol. 5,
139–548 (London: Rivington, 1824 [1692]), 411.
70. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.25.
71. Ibid., 1.29; see also 1.24; 1.84. The exegesis of Gen. 1:28 covers eighteen paragraphs of the first treatise.
Ibid., 1.23–40.
72. Ibid., 1.32; 1.39. Parker becomes rather excited about this shared position concerning original common
ownership, to the point of letting his syntax slip: “No one person had any more natural rights to those things
that God provided than had anyone else . . . it is essential to see in Locke’s discussion of property that the
difference that Locke evokes concerns humans and other created things. It is not, as Filmer argues, a
difference between human beings themselves, an original natural inequality.” Parker, The Biblical Politics of
John Locke, 133.
73. Locke even entertains the possibility that, should a man not have any kin to whom he can pass his property at
death, it would revert to the commons. In political states, this means the magistrate, but in the state of
nature, it would be to the original form of commons. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter
Concerning T
oleration, 1.90.
74. Ibid., 2.26.


75. Ibid., 1.39; 1.41; 1.86-87; 1.92; 1.97. The idea of raiment is a slip, because Adam and Eve were naked.
76. Ibid., 2.28.
77. Ibid., 2.26.
78. Parker simply ignores Locke’s constant evocations of “Indians” and North America—an extraordinary
omission, particularly in light of the brutal history of Newfoundland, where Parker was located. Parker, The
Biblical Politics of John Locke, 132–38. In light of such ignorance, one can understand Charles Mills’s
manifesto. Mills, The Racial Contract.
79. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.49.
80. Ibid., 2.27.
81. Ibid., 2.27; 2.28.
82. Macpherson, The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke, 221.
83. At two other points in the first treatise, Locke mentions Gen. 3:19, though both instances are curiously
muted and serve another purpose. In the first case, the text simply means that Adam is a day laborer rather
than the universal monarch. In the second, the text offers an example of the simplicity of labor. Adam was a
simple laborer like most of us. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 1.44–45.
Waldron completely misreads Locke here, suggesting that Locke saw labor as a curse. Waldron, The Right to
Private Property, 147.

86. Ibid., 2.29.
87. Ibid., 2.30.
88. Ibid., 2.30.
89. Ibid., 2.33.
90. For Locke, plenty of land can be found throughout the earth, especially since he disregards the “wretched”
indigenes in his favorite point of comparison, North America. Just as it was in the time of Adam and Noah, if
not Abraham, Lot, Jacob, and Esau, so it is in America today. Ibid., 2.36; 2.38.
91. Locke betrays some nervousness concerning his creative exegesis of Genesis, repeating the same point a little
later: “And hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we see are joined together. The
one gave title to the other. So that God, by commanding to subdue, gave authority so far to appropriate: and
the condition of human life, which requires labour and materials to work on, necessarily introduces private
possessions.” Ibid., 2.35.
92. Parker swallows this proposal, hook, line, and sinker. Parker, The Biblical Politics of John Locke, 134.
93. Locke, T
wo T

the path of calm continuity.
98. Locke, T
wo T

99. Note the allusion to “sweat of your brow” from Gen. 3:19.
100. Locke, T
wo T
reatises of Government and A Letter Concerning T
oleration, 2.43. As we will see, Adam Smith
deploys this tale for his assertion of the wondrous importance of the division of labor.
101. Ibid., 2.41.
102. Note also: “The great and chief end, therefore, of men’s uniting into commonwealths, and putting
themselves under government, is the preservation of their property. To which in the state of nature there are
many things wanting.” Ibid., 2.124; see also 2.3; 1.92.
