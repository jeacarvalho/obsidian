Adam Smith the Storyteller
The desire of being believed, or the desire of persuading, of leading and directing other people, seems to be one of the
strongest of all our natural desires. [1]
 
Adam Smith’s skill was as a storyteller, a mythmaker of the first order. W
e must admit
it took us a while to realize where his appeal lies. His claim to fame, W
ealth of Nations, is
badly written, deeply contradictory,[2] strikingly lacking in originality and insight,[3] full
of rampant polemic, cavalier with evidence, and rambling to the point of distraction—
from its intricate detail on herrings to the inner workings of the Bank of Amsterdam,
from lengthy discourses on turnpike tolls to the dreadful state of universities.[4] These
contradictions sit strangely with the popularity of his writing, both then and now
.[5]
How to understand that appeal? W
e suggest it may be found in his ability to construct
myths, to tell stories in a way that draws in the reader. His work is brimming with
vignettes, moral tales, parables, and grand myths. In this way, he was able to make
accessible various ideas concerning economic thought at the time, offering not so much
a synthesis that captured the imagination as a vast and imaginative narrative. For this
reason, our interest focuses on Smith the storyteller.
To be sure, many of these myths are recycled versions of those that had preceded him,
not least the travelers’ tales of which he was so fond and from which he drew much of his
ethnocentric material. W
e have analyzed already the myths of Grotius and Locke, but
Smith lifts those stories to a whole new level. Before we examine his tales, we discuss his
approach to human nature, focusing on his assertion that human beings naturally truck,
barter and exchange, and then on that contested category of self-interest, or self-love as
he tended to call it, in relation to the much-debated “invisible hand.” The bulk of our


analysis concerns the types of story Smith deploys, including sayings, moral tales,
vignettes, and parables. Above all, we devote considerable attention to his two key myths
—the foundation myth and the grand narrative. W
e conclude with reflections on the
nature of myth as it pertains to Smith’s mythopoesis, to his projected utopia and the
transitional position he occupies in economic theory.
Human Nature
Adam Smith hardly seems to have been troubled by the struggles over human nature that
beset John Locke and his contemporaries. In part, this may be due to the fact that the
significant changes taking place in human nature a century or so earlier—marked by
intense arguments over that nature—had been somewhat consolidated and become the
norm.[6] That is, the changes effected by the gradual spread of capitalism were coming to
seem normal in their own right. Therefore, Smith could assert without argument that
liberty was natural and private property sacred.[7] With property at least he does make
passing reference to the myth that Locke constructed, according to which everything was
held in common until it became private property. However, the reference comprises, at
most, a sentence or two, providing the assumed backdrop to treatments of land rent,
which arose only after land became private property.[8]
Truck, Barter, and Exchange
Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.[9]
Beyond these two items, Smith adds an observation that has since become a slogan of
the ideologues of capitalism: there exists, he writes, a “certain propensity in human
nature,” namely “the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.”[10]
Aware that this may be a contested suggestion, he offers not detailed argument to back it
up but a fable concerning dogs. First, however, he tosses a decoy. In passing, he suggests
that this propensity may be either a primary principle of human nature or the
consequence of reason and speech. With the feint made, he can quickly move to his real
point: “It is common to all men.”
W
e would like to make three observations concerning this slogan. To begin with, it is
obviously a universalizing move, made from Smith’s assumed position as advisor to the
ruling class. If one assumes that such a time-bound feature of capitalism is a universal
feature of human nature, the story of humanity may be rewritten. History thereby


becomes a vast account of the unfolding of capitalism, and Smith himself attempts
precisely such a retelling. Second, the statement reveals the naivety of Smith’s approach
to human nature. Left to themselves, human beings seek no more than to exchange and
barter with one another. Gone is any notion of evil and human propensities to do ill to
themselves and to one another. Instead, we calmly get on with the business of life, all of
which is ultimately for our good. This feature emerges frequently in Smith’s various
tales and myths. To be sure, villains also appear in his stories, but they are interfering
governments, greedy medieval proprietors, and the like. Leave man to himself with his
propensity to truck, barter, and exchange, and the world hums along rather nicely.
Such naivety may seem strange for one who was, after all, a Professor of Moral
Philosophy at the University of Glasgow (where he took the chair of a man he admired,
Francis Hutcheson). Yet, a quick look at his earlier The Theory of Moral Sentiments reveals
an equally naïve view of human nature.[11] In this work, Smith offers a rather detached
view of human engagement from an elite perspective,  drained of anything that makes
life interesting. According to his theory, we can show an interest in the fortunes and
misfortunes of others only through what he calls sympathy—“our fellow-feeling with
any passion whatsoever.”[12] W
e can do so only through the impressions made upon us
and the way we respond to them, through the ability to imagine what it would be like to
experience what the other person is experiencing. Pleasure is therefore dependent on
being able to sympathize successfully, discomfort from being unable to do so. Where is
sex, one wonders, or political passion?[13] These are notably absent in a pale and
passionless work—not surprising for a man who lived with his mother and whom his
contemporaries found decidedly creepy. But we would like to ask: What are the
implications for self-improvement, for bettering ourselves? Initially, the answer is that we
seek public approval—an approval that is marked by status and the esteem of others. Yet,
given the detached nature of this process and the uncertainty of knowing precisely how
other people function, Smith then seeks to internalize this other person, this spectator, as
the man or demi-god “within the breast.” Always well-informed of our motives, this
ideal spectator takes the position of one who is, theoretically, fully aware of what is going
on. This is hardly an original position, for it is a variation on the old and unremarkable
idea of conscience–the voice within that supposedly ensures we tread the path of virtue.
[14] The same can be said of economic activity: “It is the consciousness of this merited
approbation and esteem which is alone capable of supporting the agent in this tenour of
conduct.”[15] In other words, the drive to self-improvement is due to the desire to improve
our social status. Furthermore, we can understand what the esteem of others might be by


internalizing the response of the other whose approval we seek. This process
unwittingly, but fortunately, results in social acceptability: “The habits of œconomy,
industry, discretion, attention, and application of thought, are generally supposed to be
cultivated from self-interested motives, and at the same time are apprehended to be very
praiseworthy qualities, which deserve the esteem and approbation of everybody.”[16] And
just in case we might imagine that self-improvement and status are mere intangibles,
Smith makes it clear that it is actual fortune that achieves such status.[17]
Finally, let us return to the text in W
ealth of Nations, immediately following the
assertion that human beings naturally truck, barter, and exchange. As we indicated
earlier, Smith offers not an argument but a cute fable of the dogs. The dogs stand in for
all animals, whose nature is said to be different from that of human beings. Do animals
also exchange with one another? Two greyhounds may appear to act together when
chasing a hare—turning to each other from time to time—but that movement is only a
coincidence brought about by their common passion. After all, “Nobody ever saw a dog
make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.” Indeed,
“Nobody ever saw one animal by its gestures and natural cries signify to another, this is
mine, that yours; I am willing to give this for that.”[18] A dog can obtain something it
wants only by currying favor with its master. Exchange or barter simply does not enter
into the equation. Obviously a fable like this is no replacement for argument.
Nevertheless, such a story is certainly readable (perhaps even entertaining), designed to
appeal at another and more persuasive level.
Self-Love and the Invisible Hand
Self-love may frequently be a virtuous motive of action.[19]
Two other linked features of human nature appear in Smith’s work—self-interest and the
invisible hand. In the long-running philosophical contest between self-interest and
benevolence, Smith sides more firmly with the former. Or rather, through the exercise of
self-interest, one unwittingly benefits the social whole. Already in The Theory of Moral
Sentiments he argues against the likes of Hutcheson—who asserts self-love to be a rather
sordid business that never produces virtue—and against Bernard Mandeville, for whom
self-interest is a vice that paradoxically contributes to social goodness.[20] On the
contrary, suggests Smith: this common feature of our nature may very well “appear
virtuous, or deserve esteem and commendation from any body.”[21] This suggestion
becomes a full-blooded position in W
ealth of Nations, where he opines: “It is not from the


benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from
their regard to their own interest.”[22] In other words, we appeal in vain to the
benevolence of others, for we will gain much more by appealing to their self-interests. It
is really a case of that initial principle of exchange: you get what you want, and, in the
process, I get what I want.
Yet Smith goes a step further, suggesting that self-interest is the true mode by which
society benefits. Natural to human beings, it also (like medicine) “frequently restores
health and vigour to the constitution.”[23] This contribution to progress and increased
wealth is not only a by-product of self-interest but also a part of a larger project. The
individual is actually led to choose the pursuit that best suits the advantages of society at
large.[24] At this point, Smith is closing in on his passing observation concerning the
invisible hand. Before we discuss that benevolent member, a couple of observations need
to be made. To begin with, any theological concern with greed is well and truly gone.
And once that happens, greed itself may be morally recoded as beneficial, as a crucial
element of human nature that lifts not only the individual but also the entire social fabric.
Or rather—and this is the second point—Smith relocates the moral opposition.[25] In
opposition to this benign form of self-interest, another negative form appears. It may be
the medieval proprietors of Europe or the opulent courts that sucked the economic life out
of whatever place they happened to occupy. It may be the man of fortune, who spends his
wealth on “frivolous objects, the little ornaments of dress and furniture, jewels, trinkets,
gewgaws,” who is guilty not only of a trifling disposition, but also a “base and selfish”
one.[26]
This type of moral recoding runs throughout Smith’s work, so much so that W
ealth
of Nations may be seen at one level as a sprawling morality play, full of evil villains and
virtuous heroes. Thus, the industrious merchants who compete with one another in the
free market, as well as those who understand the value of agriculture, are the good guys:
they pursue their own interests and in the process contribute to the social whole. By
contrast, the evil characters are a motley collection of interfering governments,
monopolies, guilds, prodigal individuals and groups, and opposing economic theorists
(Mercantilists, for instance). Governments enact detrimental regulations such as the Corn
Laws; monopolies and guilds stifle competition; prodigals spend rather than practice
frugality; and erroneous theorists do more bad than good. Thankfully, like the one who
lends to a man so that he may spend, sometimes such an evil character may “have
occasion to repent of his folly.”[27]
Let us return to the overworked idea of the “invisible hand,” for under its benevolent


sway, self-love works for the greater glory of wealth and social wellbeing, which is really
a code for capitalism. This concealed appendage has received more than its fair share of
attention, given that Smith refers to it only three times in his written work, once as the
curious “invisible hand of Jupiter’’[28] and then in The Theory of Moral Sentiments and
W
ealth of Nations. In the former, the rich engage in their natural selfishness and rapacity.
Thereby:
They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which
would have made, had the earth been divided into equal proportions among all its inhabitants, and thus
without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the
multiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither
forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition.[29]
It may be possible to read this text in terms of the opposition of individual vice and
social virtue that Smith inherited from Mandeville. Here, the rapacity of the ruling class
works inexorably for the good of society. Yet, it is by no means clear that Smith saw
such rapacity as a vice, for this is what the rich do naturally. By contrast, the specific use
of the term in W
ealth of Nations is to bolster Smith’s favored domestic industry over
foreign trade:
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of
domestick industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every
individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally,
indeed, neither intends to promote the publick interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By
preferring the support of domestick to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by
directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his
own gain, and he is in this, as in many other eases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was
no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his
own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to
promote it.[30]
The phrase, as it appears in W
ealth of Nations, has become rubbed and worn by passing
through too many hands. Many have extracted the invisible hand from the particular
concern of this passage with domestic industry and extended it to become an image of
how the possessive individualism of capitalism works to spread capitalism as a whole.
But we are interested in another feature of this concealed appendage, namely, the
debates that continue concerning its theological tenor. Some argue that it is a secular
concept, a mere metaphor shorn of any theological or teleological outer layer and thereby
expressing a deeper truth of capitalism.[31] Others assert, somewhat vociferously, that it is
a comprehensively theological concept, relying on the thoroughly theological idea of


Providence.[32] Taking sides is hardly the issue here, for by doing so one buys into the
submerged threshold that shapes the horizon of the debates over theology and
economics, a horizon that we trying to illuminate in this work. In this light, we suggest
that the debate itself is symptomatic of Smith’s own ambivalent and transitional
position. By casually dropping in the phrase, he could both nod to the assumed
understanding of the invisible hand as providential, as part of the greater plan of a rather
distant deity, and he could join the increasingly secular trajectory of thought at the time.
This ambiguity is what enables the diverging readings of the gargantuan “hand” waving
over the mundane self-interest of the little creatures below
.[33] One can hardly expect
otherwise, given Smith’s own version of what is best called Stoic-inspired Deism. An
abstract God may have created the universe at some point in the dim and distant past, but
that God has since retired or, perhaps, taken a long Sabbath rest. This is not so much a
“hidden theology,” as Lisa Hill and others have argued, but a case of God abandoning the
world, to borrow a phrase from Lukács.[34] This abandonment is the mark of modernity,
which must find a new form of cohesion and a new source of meaning. Smith appears at
the transition to that modernity, trailing in the dust of past theological debates that
continue to swirl around him but also peering through the dust to a world that God has
left to its own devices.[35] In this context, Deism is the appropriate position to take, for it
is really a decompression chamber from the concerns of theology and the church.
W
e would like to close this engagement with the invisible hand on another note. In
the Hebrew Bible, yad (hand) is occasionally used as a euphemism for penis. For instance,
in the Song of Songs 5:4, one of the lovers puts his “hand” to the hole.[36] In Ezek. 2:9,
the phallic and engorged scroll festooned with writing is given to the prophet by a “hand
stretched out.”[37] Given the phallic propensities of the god of the Hebrew Bible, it takes
little imagination to see the mighty hand of God (Exod. 32:11, Deut. 4:34) as also an
assertion of seminal masculine power.[38] Given the unremittingly masculine concerns of
Adam Smith especially, and of males of ruling class propensities generally, we would
suggest that the invisible or hidden hand may also be seen as a subconscious allusion to
the member concealed in his pants. After all, Smith is certainly not averse to the
occasional biblical allusion.
Tall Tales
Smith was the great eclectic.[39]
He may have been a little lacking in philosophical acumen and a little dependent on


others (especially Mandeville, Hutcheson, and Hume) for his economic thought, but
Smith certainly made up for these shortcomings with his ability to spin a yarn. W
ealth of
Nations is a veritable anthology of fables, sayings, vignettes, moral tales, parables, and,
above all, myths. The items we discussed earlier—freedom of the market, the propensity
for human beings to barter and exchange, self-love, and the “invisible hand”—find their
true home in the stories that crowd W
ealth of Nations.[40] W
e devote most of our
attention to the grand myths, but we would like to set the scene with some comments on
Smith’s formulae of introduction and the types of story that appear in his work. Smith’s
vignettes and moral tales tend to begin with “let us suppose,”[41] while his grand
narrative opens with “in ancient times.” A little like “once upon a time,” the latter
transports us back to ancient Greece and Rome, or perhaps the history of England in the
dim and distant past. The myths themselves are usually introduced by “in the rude state
of society,” when we are taken to the earliest moments of human existence in order to
trace the origins of economic activity.
Sayings, Moral Tales, and Vignettes
W
e have already mentioned his liking for fables,[42] so let us provide a taste of his sayings
by offering a couple of morsels—one concerning a water pond, and the other a shaky
inn:
The project of replenishing their coffers in this manner may be compared to that of a man who had a water-
pond from which a stream was continually running out, and into which no stream was continually
running, but who proposed to keep it always equally full by employing a number of people to go
continually with buckets to a well at some miles distance in order to bring water to replenish it.[43]
 
The house is crazy, says a weary traveller to himself, and will not stand very long; but it is a chance if it
falls to-night, and I will venture, therefore, to sleep in it to-night.[44]
Apart from a notable lack of humor, both examples maintain a rather earnest moral tone.
Indeed, the crazy house appears in the midst of a moral tale concerning the practice of
dubious bills of exchange, which one moves perpetually about in order to delay
repayment.[45]  Other moral tales include (to name but a few): the folly of the Ayr Bank of
Scotland, which opened in 1769 and folded soon after, in 1772; the dangers of lotteries;
the risk inherent in searching for new mines; and the juggling trick of reducing precious
metals in coinage.[46] In order to gain a sense of these syrupy tales, we quote an example
concerning the merchant and the country gentleman:


Merchants are commonly ambitious of becoming country gentlemen, and when they do, they are generally
the best of all improvers. A merchant is accustomed to employ his money chiefly in profitable projects;
whereas a mere country gentleman is accustomed to employ it chiefly in expence. The one often sees his
money go from him and return to him again with a profit: the other, when once he parts with it, very
seldom expects to see any more of it. Those different habits naturally affect their temper and disposition in
every sort of business. A merchant is commonly a bold; a country gentleman, a timid undertaker . . .
Whoever has had the fortune to live in a mercantile town situated in an unimproved country, must have
frequently observed how much more spirited the operations of merchants were in this way, than those of
mere country gentlemen. The habits, besides, of order, economy and attention, to which mercantile business
naturally forms a merchant, render him much fitter to execute, with profit and success, any project of
improvement.[47]
The moral coding of Smith’s work emerges here in all its glory, a moral coding
reinforced time and again through stories such as this. The industrious merchant is of
course the virtuous one, full of spirited energy, order, economy, and boldness. He is able
to generate profit and thereby improve the condition of the land itself. By contrast, the
country gentleman simply has not a clue. A timid person, he lacks the discipline needed
for real improvement.
Parables
The moral tale we just quoted spills into the dominant form of the parable, although the
demarcations between various types are never firm. Parables exist in abundance,
especially when Smith wishes to persuade readers concerning an initial assertion. Forget
any extended analysis of empirical data, of tables and calculations, or factory reports, and
so forth. When he needs to make a point, a parable is far more useful. As we cannot
tackle them all, we have selected a few of the better examples.[48]
The first needs only a brief mention, for it is nothing less than a comprehensive gloss
of the parable of the Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32. Smith sets up an initial opposition
between the prodigal and prudent (or frugal) man, and develops a tale of the growth of
capitalism in England in light of the opposition. However, the whole account
reconfigures the relationship between the two, for the prodigal becomes the reprehensible
figure in the story, while the frugal character is praised. When the prodigal (a king,
government, or landlord) dominates, economic growth is threatened, but when the frugal
and sober son comes to the fore, the story begins to sound more cheerful.
However, the second parable is more typical of Smith’s storytelling. It concerns the
borrowed parable of the pin:
To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has


been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which
the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed
in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce,
perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the
way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided
into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the
wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head;
to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the
pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making
a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are
all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of
them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of
them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and
therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted
themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four
thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-
eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins,
might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought
separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they
certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the
two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present
capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.
[49]
An apology must be offered for quoting the text in full, but it reveals Smith’s penchant
for verbosity. For Smith, the parable seeks to drive home the crucial role of the division of
labor, with which he opens W
ealth of Nations. Not content with one parable, he soon
offers another (“The Course Coat”), although the point is largely the same.[50] Smith was
evidently fond of the parable of the pin, for it also appears in his Lectures on Jurisprudence.
[51]He was also quite possessive of it, accusing Adam Ferguson, a former friend, of
plagiarizing the parable in the latter’s Principles of Moral and Political Science.[52] It takes
one to know one: Smith seems to have drawn the parable from the entry under
“Épingles” in the French Encyclopaedie of 1755, in which eighteen steps in the process of
pin-making also appear, even though the English pin-makers used twenty-five. Be that
as it may, the apparently wondrous process of the division of labor was by no means new
to Smith, for it recalls Locke’s account of the making of bread in his Two Treatises of
Government.[53]
One further example, “Daedalian Wings,” foreshadows our treatment of myth. Smith
begins by noting the operations of a judicious bank, which uses paper money as a
substitute for a significant portion of its gold and silver, thereby making available
productive stock.


The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway,
which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself not a
single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent a
metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the air; enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its
highways into good pastures and corn fields, and thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce
of its land and labour. The commerce and industry of the country, however, it must be acknowledged,
though they may be somewhat augmented, cannot be altogether so secure, when they are thus, as it were,
suspended upon the Daedalian wings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the solid ground of
gold and silver.[54]
Suspicions of paper money emerge here—suspicions that Smith would voice on more
than one occasion. Compared to the solid ground of gold and silver, one may travel on a
wagon-way through the air or perhaps fly like Daedalus high into the heavens. Daedalus,
of course, flew a little too close to the sun, melting the wax that held the feathers to his
arms. One must therefore be careful with such an unreliable thing as paper money, for
with its enabling possibilities come the risks of crashing to the ground. However, what
intrigues us here is Smith’s deployment of metaphors typical of myths.[55] Roadways
through the sky and the paper wings of money evoke not only the Greek myths that
Smith—given his elite education—knew well, but also the myths he sought to rewrite.
Myths
By this legendary tale . . .[56]
The parables may be crucial for the purpose of making a particular point, but the most
powerful of Smith’s literary devices is myth. It provides an over-arching framework, a
comprehensive story that claims the reader’s assent. In comparison with Grotius and
Locke, the absence of the struggle with the biblical specificities of the myth is
immediately apparent. Or rather, the struggle has been excised from the explicit content
of Smith’s construction and transposed to a deeper level. And that is the tension between
a narrative of difference and identity, according to which the myth either narrates a
transition from a very different past or tells a story of how those mythical forebears were
identical to us. Yet, even as he attempts to construct a myth, Smith enters a zone where
the Bible reigns supreme. W
e hardly need to point out that the success and influence of
the biblical narratives is their mythic nature, their ability to produce a story by which one
may live. At a formal level, Smith follows in their wake.
Two distinct myths appear in W
ealth of Nations, although they seep into one another
through their porous edges. The first we have titled “The Rude State of Society,” the


formula that opens his initial account of this myth and then signals its return at later
moments in the text. As the title suggests, Smith imaginatively retells the story of the
first human societies in a way that suits his purposes. The second myth, usually
introduced with the phrase, “In ancient times,” serves as the grand narrative that details
the trek from ancient Greece and Rome, briefly through Europe, and then to England.
Once our intrepid marchers-of-progress have arrived on England’s fair and pleasant
shores, they must often endure long-winded accounts of England’s dim and distant past
before emerging in the smog of its present glory.
In the Rude State of Society: The Foundation Myth
In its first appearance in W
ealth of Nations, the foundation myth seeks to “prove” Smith’s
initial assertion that human beings naturally engage in trucking, bartering, and
exchanging. In fact, it follows hard on the tail of that assertion:[57]
In a tribe of hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more
readiness and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his
companions; and he finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison, than if he himself
went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows
grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and
covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours,
who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to
dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a
third becomes a smith or a brazier, a fourth a tanner or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the
clothing of savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of
his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s
labour as he may have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and
to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he may possess for that particular species of
business.[58]
In place of Adam and Eve we find a tribe; instead of strife and conflict, we see calm
diligence in a particular kind of business; in lieu of rupture and banishment are
cultivation and perfection. Idyllic, even Edenic, the opening of this myth is at some
remove from the biblical account with which Locke and Grotius had to struggle. The key
components of this peaceful tribe include self-interest, dedication, cultivation, and mutual
exchange. Smith goes on to suggest that the different skills and trades already mentioned
arise not from nature but from “habit, custom, and education.”[59] What does come from
nature is the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange—a disposition that leads to the
different talents and thereby professions people pursue. Even more, that same disposition


ensures that the vastly different professions are actually of some use to one another,
brought “into a common stock, where every man may purchase whatever part of the
produce of other men’s talents he has occasion for.”[60]
Thus far, we have followed the myth in the second chapter of the first book of W
ealth
of Nations.[61] It continues in the fourth chapter:
When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but a very small part of a man’s
wants which the produce of his own labour can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by
exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own
consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he has occasion for. Every man thus
lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is
properly a commercial society.[62]
Our primitive forebears were capitalists at heart, it seems—natural merchants in the
business of specialization, producing surpluses, and constantly exchanging them with
one another. Smith can be long-winded, so we will summarize the remainder of the
myth. Once our primitives have all busied themselves with their natural propensity to
produce and “truck,” they soon find that others have enough of whatever is on offer: “this
power of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in
its operations.”[63] For example: I may have made plenty of toe ticklers, but now that the
tribe or village is full of toe ticklers, I have nowhere to hawk my wares and get what I
want. The solution: stockpile items that I am sure everyone will want—salt, sugar, dried
cod, dressed leather, sex toys—so that when I want something, I can simply use these
items in exchange. Given the cumbersome nature of these items, someone hits on the
idea of using precious metals for such a purpose, at first weighed, but then standardized,
and minted as coins. Eventually, in our wisdom, we come up with credit, or virtual
money.
Adam Smith repeats this favored myth on numerous occasions. Or rather, he invokes
it with minor variations whenever he wishes to introduce a new topic, such as the
question of stock, labor and its produce, fishing, the produce of land (meat and corn),
land rent, wood,[64] or even a complete reiteration of the initial form of the myth
concerning the division of labor.[65] Smith may have begun with the division of labor,
but on each occasion, he adds yet another item to what gradually becomes quite a
collection. The net effect is to reinforce the basic postulate that those economic
primitives are at heart the same as us, for human nature is universal.
If the myth is good enough for Smith to repeat, it is good for enough for the
economists following in his wake to do so. Even David Ricardo, who disagreed with so


many of Smith’s proposals, quotes the myth and turns it into a grand tale of the origins
of exchange value.[66] In economics textbooks, online forums, and classes on economics,
“the most important story ever told”[67] has been retold again, and again, and again. The
problem is that it is a pure fantasy-land. Where is this mythical village or tribe? Does it
exist among North American Indians, Asian pastoral nomads, African tribes, Pacific
Islanders, Greenlandic hunters, Australian Aborigines, or a small Scottish town of
shopkeepers? Is it limited to the past, or does it appear in some remote place today? Often
in the same myth it moves from one place or time to another, producing an ethnic other
as it does so.[68] But the simple fact is that this tribe or village never existed. No such
community has ever been found, nor will it be, for it is only the product of Smith’s
imagination.
While it is necessary to point out the mythical status of this story and counter it with
empirical evidence, such an approach is insufficient and ineffective with regard to myth.
No amount of “facts” will dent the power of myth, as Sorel showed so well many years
ago.[69] Instead, it is more worthwhile to ask what truth the myth expresses, given that a
myth is always split between fiction and a deeper and not always pleasant, truth (part of
the mixed heritage of the very sense of myth).[70] W
e suggest the function of this myth is
to create a new entity, a projection that that must gain an existence all to itself. This is
“the economy,” or more specifically “the market.” Here the epithet “free,” attached to
“market” is a crucial signal, for the market should be—as a pure project—free from any
ties. And the reason why such a projection was needed was because a relatively new
discipline needed an object of study.
W
e will return to this question concerning the nature of myth in the conclusion, but
now we would like to close this discussion of the foundation myth of Adam Smith on
another note: the question of the struggle between narratives of difference and identity.
Thus far, the content of the myth seems to reflect the process of its creation. Just as those
early villagers or tribal members become entrepreneurs with remarkable ease, so also does
the myth itself unfold on the pages of W
ealth of Nations without tension and struggle.
But is this really the case? Could Smith also have struggled—like Grotius and Locke—to
produce his foundation myth as it appears in W
ealth of Nations? Struggle may be too
strong a word, for there is evidence of confusion, of a lack of clarity concerning plot
lines. For that, we must turn to the Lectures on Jurisprudence, unpublished during his
lifetime but delivered before W
ealth of Nations was published. In those lectures Smith
observes:
If we should suppose 10 or 12 persons of different sexes settled in an uninhabited island, the first method


they would fall upon for their sustenance would be to support themselves by the wild fruits and wild
animalls which the country afforded. Their sole business would be hunting the wild beasts or catching the
fishes. The pulling of a wild fruit can hardly be called an imployment. The only thing amongst them which
deserved the appellation of a business would be the chase.[71]
Contrasted with the inhabitants of the foundation myth, the primitives in this
Robinsonade can hardly be said to truck, barter, and exchange. Indeed, one can barely
say that they are engaged in any employment or business whatsoever, apart perhaps from
the chase. Those activities appear later, with the phase of agriculture in ancient Greece
and Rome, and then in medieval Europe. In other words, Smith here opts for a narrative
of difference rather than identity. The hunters and their ilk are not like us, so a transit of
difference is needed, an account of how we came to be who we are from such contrary
origins. The four stages proposed in the Lectures on Jurisprudence attempt precisely such a
transit as they move through hunters, shepherds, agriculture, and commerce.[72] Smith’s
adherence to this structure in the lectures is neither particularly concise, nor is it entirely
free from contradiction; but its over-arching plot is a narrative of difference.
However, towards the close of those lectures, his tone changes:
By this disposition to barter and exchange the surplus of ones labour for that of other people, in a nation of
hunters, if any one has a talent for making bows and arrows better than his neighbours he will at first make
presents of them, and in return get presents of their game. By continuing this practice he will live better
than before and will have no occasion to provide for himself, as the surplus of his own labour does it more
effectualy.[73]
Clearly, Smith now begins to adopt a narrative of identity, offering a rudimentary form of
the foundation myth familiar from its dominance in W
ealth of Nations. Apart from
attributing the tension between these two plots, between a narrative of difference and one
of identity,[74] to Smith’s own obvious limitations, we would like to suggest that the
tension may also be read at another level, namely as a formal manifestation of the
struggles that beset Grotius and Locke.
These were of course the struggles that centered on the biblical narrative of the Fall.
With its rupture between the garden and the postlapsarian state—between an existence
free of labor and private property within the garden and a situation outside the gates of
the garden fueled by labor and private property beyond the garden—the story of the Fall
is clearly a narrative of difference. The problem for Grotius and Locke is that they want a
narrative of identity and continuity, through the biblical text itself. To solve the problem,
they situate private property and labor before the Fall, as an unfolding of created human
nature, indeed as the outcome of the divine command to subdue the earth. In order to


achieve this shift, they displace the Fall to a later point in the biblical narrative, delve into
the tradition of the Fortuitous Fall, smuggle items into the garden from biblical texts
outside the gates, or they simply attempt to sidestep the account of disobedience and
banishment. Of course, we hardly find the particularities of such struggles in the myth of
Adam Smith. What we do find is a deeper, structural struggle over narratives of difference
and identity. At this level, the battles that beset Grotius and Locke show their continued
influence on Smith’s own efforts. Yet, the very fact that we have had to dig deeper also
indicates that biblical and theological concerns are more distant from Smith’s immediate
concerns and more deeply sublated within the structure of his writing.
In Ancient Times
With the grand narrative, which is often introduced (to cite Smith’s spelling) with “In
antient times . . .,” we encounter endless discourses on various features of ancient Greece
and Rome, or perhaps ancient England or parts of Europe. It may be a speculative story
concerning seafaring and river navigation, an account of prices, the story of education, a
narrative of agriculture in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, or a story
concerning profits and interest extending into continental Europe.[75] One of the most
notable examples is the grand narrative of the slow development of free markets in
Europe. Like a history of salvation, it includes sins and hindrances and regresses (such as
feudal proprietors and ham-fisted government efforts at regulation), followed by
repentance, then liberty and independence. Eventually, the free market emerges despite, or
perhaps because of, these hindrances: “It is that through the greater part of Europe the
commerce and manufactures of cities, instead of being the effect, have been the cause and
occasion of the improvement and cultivation of the country.”[76]
A couple of hints of an even grander narrative appear, especially via the four stages of
hunters, shepherds, agriculture, and commerce. They turn up in the disorganized Lectures
on Jurisprudence and then several times in the fifth book of W
ealth of Nations.[77] In
Smith’s time, such periodic schemas were common fare in works on economics, social
forms, government, and law—disciplines we now call the social sciences. Yet, it would be
somewhat futile to attempt to knit together all of Smith’s historical and ethnographic
imaginings of W
ealth of Nations into these stages, for at least three reasons. First, Smith
does not (or perhaps is unable to) do so; his flights of thought spill outside these stages,
particularly in the construction of the foundation myth we discussed earlier. Second,
Smith restricts the use of the four stages in W
ealth of Nations only to the development of


warfare and partially to law
, but not to questions of economics, social development, and
government. The third problem is the most telling. Smith attempts to assert a narrative of
identity in W
ealth of Nations at odds with the narrative of difference embodied in the four
stages as they appear in the Lectures on Jurisprudence. As we argued earlier, the narrative
of identity is the core of the foundation myth, which takes on a life of its own to include
elements of what formerly belonged to the hunters, shepherds, and agriculture, in a way
that makes distinctions between these stages difficult.
The most important features of the grand narrative lie elsewhere, in its chronic
ethnocentrism and false universalism. The consummate mythmaker and consummate
racist, Smith constructs his grand narrative through the constant production of ethnic
others and continual ethnic slurs. In the opening sentences of W
ealth of Nations, he offers
this general contrast between the “savage” and “civilized” nations:
Such nations, however, are so miserably poor, that, from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or, at least,
think themselves reduced, to the necessity sometimes of directly destroying, and sometimes of abandoning
their infants, their old people, and those afflicted with lingering diseases, to perish with hunger, or to be
devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and thriving nations, on the contrary . . . the produce of the
whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly supplied, and a workman, even of the
lowest and poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and
conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.[78]
W
e begin with this text because it introduces a leitmotiv of the almost endless pages that
follow in this work. Indeed, it structures the work as a whole, seeking reasons why those
“civilized” nations have achieved wealth, while the “savage” nations have not. It is worth
noting here that the final contrast between the lowliest of the civilized and the savage
already appears in Locke: “A king of a large and fruitful territory there feeds, lodges, and
is clad worse than a day-labourer in England.”[79] Locke locates his “savage” king
among the indigenous people in North America, but the point is the same. Later, Smith
too moves the “savage” about, finding him also as a king in Africa. Now the
accommodation of “an industrious and frugal peasant . . . exceeds that of many an
African king, the absolute master of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked
savages.”[80]
Racial insults flow thick and fast throughout the book. The ancient Peruvians and
Mexicans were “in arts, agriculture, and commerce . . . more ignorant than the Tartars of
the Ukraine are at present.” After all, “the ancient arts of Mexico and Peru have never
furnished one single manufacture to Europe.”[81] Or, in “unfortunate” countries, where
people are afraid of violent superiors, they bury a greater part of their goods: “This is said
to be a common practice in Turkey, in Indostan, and, I believe, in most other


governments of Asia.”[82] (The “I believe” is a crucial signal, to which we return in a
moment.) The list is already long, including Peruvians, Mexicans, Tartars of Ukraine,
Turkey, Indostan, and the whole of Asia. To these he adds ancient Egypt, “Mahometan”
nations, the Arabs, Africa, the W
est Indies, Persia, Bengal, Siam, China,[83] and, of
course, North American indigenous peoples, who comprise “the lowest and rudest state
of society.”[84] As a result, nearly the entire world apart from Europe is characterized as
“savage” and “barbaric.” Even then, he often characterizes the otiose French or brutal
Dutch in less than glowing terms.[85]
Nonetheless, China presents a problem for Smith, as it did for his contemporaries
(such as Malthus). They were under the impression that China was still more populous,
powerful, and wealthy than Europe, so it seemed to escape the category of “savage” or
“barbarian.” What to do? While Smith occasionally pays lip service to this impression,
[86] he also partakes of the general pastime of showing that China is not as good as it
seems. China is actually stagnant, he suggests. Its great age is no longer seen as a benefit,
a source of wisdom and wealth far deeper than that of Europe. Now stability becomes
what is dull, boring, and melancholy.[87] Others voiced similar sentiments, in which
China was seen with a “broadly shared (if not unanimous) disdain” as static.[88] A little
later, Hegel opined that China was weighed down with unbearable despotism, an
absence of free spirit and of high ethical standards.[89] In short, China lacked any sense
of progress or modernity.[90] Yet Smith goes a step further:
The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe.
In the neighbourhood of Canton many hundred, it is commonly said, many thousand families have no
habitation on the land, but live constantly in little fishing boats upon the rivers and canals. The subsistence
which they find there is so scanty that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage thrown overboard from
any European ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a dead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and
stinking, is as welcome to them as the most wholesome food to the people of other countries. Marriage is
encouraged in China, not by the profitableness of children, but by the liberty of destroying them. In all
great towns several are every night exposed in the street, or drowned like puppies in the water. The
performance of this horrid office is even said to be the avowed business by which some people earn their
subsistence.[91]
The echo of the opening ethnocentric bifurcation is strong, except that now it is raised
to an even more horrifying degree—the streets and rivers are full of dead babies, since
some people earn their living through this practice. In Smith’s estimation, China is not
only “savage,” but brutally so.
From where does Smith gain all this information? Travelers’ tales are a major source,
with their lurid and overblown creations of excess. But when he is short of even this
unreliable material, he simply makes it up. Earlier we flagged a telling comment, “I


believe,” when Smith is speaking of the governments of Asia. At another point, when
writing of Bengal and the eastern provinces of China, Smith admits that he has little
evidence to support his claims, since “the great extent of this antiquity is not
authenticated by any histories of whose authority we, in this part of the world, are well
assured.”[92] Does this prevent him from proceeding, from writing of the waterways and
prevention of commerce in such places? Not at all, for he builds a picture purely from
what even he regards as unreliable material, spiced up with a healthy dose of
imagination. “Not authenticated” and “not well assured” soon become rather well assured
certainties as Smith’s pen continues across the page.
Like the foundation myth with its movable village of hunters and shepherds, the
grand narrative needs to produce an ethnic other to be a myth at all. As we discovered
with Locke, that other may exist in an imagined past or as a contemporary of a
somewhat distant place. Indeed, in the full flush of the myth, the ethnocentrism of
Smith’s work characterizes the whole world apart from England. But now we face an
apparent paradox: the very same grand narrative that requires the production of inferior
ethnicities is also the one that makes universal claims. The paradox is apparent only, for
his universalism requires the racism that it produces. Without the chronic ethnocentrism
that structures Smith’s work, the universalism of the grand narrative would not be
possible. W
e have mentioned this feature of his work briefly in relation to his opinions on
human nature as well as the foundation myth that seeks to support those opinions. Next,
we will explore how it becomes constitutive of his grand narrative.
Smith attempts to develop certain general categories of economic activity: the “most
perfect freedom of trade” is good; regulations and obstructions by governments and rulers
are bad (they restrain free competition); wherever capital appears, it leads to industry;
progress is enlivening, stagnation is deathly; “natural liberty” is the task of law to
support, not to hinder, that curious creation known as the “market”; and of course it is
human nature to truck, barter, and exchange.[93] All this is now standard ideological fare
for proponents of the “free market,” for whom Smith is the preeminent ideologue. As an
example of the extremity of Smith’s polemic, we offer his suggestion that government
intervention produces famines and that the free market can solve them. What is the real
cause of a famine? A bad season perhaps, or greedy grain speculators? No, for Adam
Smith, “a famine has never arisen from any other cause but the violence of government
attempting, by improper means, to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth.” In fact,
those stupid farmers and wasteful workers who complain of bad seasons are not making
the best use of their resources: “The scantiest crop, if managed with frugality and


economy, will maintain, through the year, the same number of people that are
commonly fed in a more affluent manner by one of moderate plenty.” But if you have a
real famine, then the solution is simply to let the grain merchants and speculators loose:
“The unlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as it is the only effectual
preventative of the miseries of a famine, so it is the best palliative of the inconveniencies
of a dearth.”[94] These merchants and speculators, he opines, face the same odium as
witches had not so long ago. But this is irrational, for they really are our saviors during
famine.[95]
Needless to say, these apparently universal criteria were developed in the particular
context of England’s late blooming as a capitalist center, in the early years of that surge
in industrialization erroneously called the “industrial revolution.”[96] This was the
moment of emergence of the British Empire, and Smith viewed that emergence as an
ideologue of the ruling class at three overlapping levels: as a scribe of the domestic ruling
class; as a member of a perceived global ruling class, of which England is the head; and
as a male intellectual. However, Smith embodied Marx’s dictum that the ruling ideas of
an age are the ideas of the ruling class.[97] As a matter of course, the ideas of that
particular class in that particular location are universal, not merely at that time and place,
but for all times and places. And if one applies those criteria to an imaginative grand
narrative, then it soon becomes apparent that people elsewhere and in earlier ages have
often not lived up to those criteria.
How does one account for these shortfalls? The selfish interventions of governments
and rulers might be blamed. Likewise, the recalcitrance of landholders and proprietors,
who allow men to behave “naturally.” Maybe the ethnic peculiarities that hold back
people in other parts of the world from manifesting these “universal” principles could be
condemned. Those Chinese, Arabs, and Africans are simply too barbaric and savage to
have yet realized their true nature as economic beings. After all, opines Smith, do they
not lack the most basic of human virtues? Do they not engage in exposing their
children, banning commerce with other nations, and desiring stagnation rather than
progress? The immediate problem here is that these racist characterizations run up
against Smith’s assertions that it is human nature to truck, barter, and exchange. If most
of history and most of the world actually do not exhibit such behavior, do they not reveal
that human nature is somewhat different than what Smith imagined? He will not
concede, so he must opt for what may be called a universal by exclusion. All human beings
naturally engage in trucking, bartering, and exchanging; all human beings thrive under
capital and the free market. If a person does not fit within these parameters, that person is


not human. “All” is thereby an exclusive and elite term, a universal that can be a universal
only by excluding the majority from the universal.
Conclusion: On Myth, Utopia, and Transitions
He became one of the sights of Edinburgh, where he was given to rambling the streets in a trance, half-
dressed and twitching all over, heatedly debating with himself in a peculiar affected voice and careering
along with his inimitable “worm like” gait.[98]
Throughout this study of Smith, we have used the terminology of myth, in particular of
his foundation myth and grand narrative. Although we earlier (and somewhat briefly)
introduced the senses in which we understand myth, here we would like to expand on
that discussion by exploring what myth means and how it functions. In popular
parlance, myth means a fabrication, a fiction that has little connection with empirical
evidence. This sense of the word has much to do with the history of the terminology of
myth, in which the old myths of areas subsequently Christianized became fairy stories
and folktales, fit for children in a way that indirectly signaled that those stories
themselves derive from the “childhood” of humanity.[99] Yet myth bears another sense, in
which it expresses a deeper truth, one that cannot be conveyed in conventional scientific
terms of cause and effect. At this level, myth deploys metaphor and image; it evokes
deeper responses through the ability to provide a story to which one assents. Again, this
sense has its own particular history. In the northern European search for “authentic”
traditions (having to do with notions of the V
olk), the ancient myths became sources for
an alternative knowledge of imagined and purer historical origins.[100] This search was
originally focused on historical traces embodied in the metaphoric language of myth,
but it has since become the idea that myth embodies a deeper truth that expresses the
hopes and fears of a story by which one may live. However, this dimension of myth also
requires a perpetual exercise of suspicion and discernment. W
e should not forget that this
awareness of the deeper truth of myth arose out of a reactionary project with rather dire
consequences.
How do these—fictional story and deeper truth—relate to Smith’s work? To begin
with, his myths are largely fictional—creations based on ideological assertions, dubious
resources, and often his own imagination. Even the editors of W
ealth of Nations admit
this point, albeit somewhat guardedly: “Smith’s objective was to delineate an ideal
account of historical evolution, which did not need to conform to any actual historical
situation, so historical evidence, while playing a central part in his thought, was


supplementary evidence of secondary importance.”[101] As we mentioned earlier, myth is
usually impervious to facts, for facts speak a different language than myth. Thus, it
should come as no surprise that the disciples of Smith’s free market simply ignore or, at
best, feebly explain away the regularity of financial crashes and depressions, the chronic
economic dependence of the majority of the world on an over-developed minority, and
the stupendous death toll that results from war waged at the hands of capitalism. The
myth itself is far stronger than the facts.
At the same time, these myths give voice to a deeper truth, a problematic truth that it
was Smith’s ability to put into a persuasive narrative form. In resuscitating and refining
the myth, Smith had a distinct agenda: to assert the existence of a relatively new being,
“the economy.”[102] The definite article is crucial, for “the” economy was to be a distinct
entity, with its own rules and its own dynamic that is distinct from politics, the state, and
above all religion. What better way to do so than reconstruct a myth in which “the”
economy emerges as a natural expression of human nature? This is perhaps the strangest
result of Smith’s mythmaking, one that would eventually be seen as a self-regulating,
equilibrium generating object that somehow has a life of its own. One is reminded of
Marx’s point that the gods are created by human beings—that they exist as projections
not of the best of human virtues (as Feuerbach would have it) but as the result of the
alienated conditions of human existence. So too is the market or economy a projection.
But why did Smith wish to create such a being? As we pointed out earlier, a new field of
study was emerging from the swamp of capitalism—the discipline of economics.[103] In
order to ensure that this discipline was not bereft of an object of study, “the economy”
was created. For our purposes, it is important to note precisely what this “economy”
designates: for Smith and those who follow
, it is already reduced to the domain of
huckstering and trading, of profit gained from a daring and innovative transaction
(albeit not without the occasional bending of the rules). Crucial to this constructed realm
—and indeed a signal of its status as a projection—is the claim that it is ideally free from
any “interference” by the state, let alone social relations and forces.
Two additional features of myth are relevant here. Myth entertains profound
contradictions, which are needed for it to work in the first place. That is to say, myth
gives voice to tensions, explores dead ends, and recounts threats that may undermine the
organizing agenda of the myth.[104] The dialectical nature of myth shows its face now at
a different level, for in the very effort to indicate how certain options are not viable, it
preserves those alternatives. Here, we find the moral coding of heroes and villains, of
good and bad, in Smith’s work. Industrious entrepreneurs, merchants, capitalist


agriculturalists, proponents of free trade, even that mythical village full of primitives who
cannot help themselves in trucking and exchanging are all virtuous characters in Smith’s
stories. Pitted against them are the evil kings, rapacious landlords, greedy governments,
lazy and stupid workers, and of course “savages” of pretty much any ethnicity besides
the English.[105] These villains constantly attempt to hijack the free market’s slow
emergence, but are in the end punished or won over. In spite of their condemnation and
punishment, the myth preserves their wide-ranging and alternative options.
The simultaneous damnation and preservation of these evil people lead to the final
point concerning myth. It constructs an ideal toward which one strives, a utopia that
remains just out of reach. W
e offer but one example (out of many depictions) of this
utopia: “W
ere all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and free
importation, the different states into which a great continent was divided would so far
resemble the different provinces of a great empire.”[106] Imagine the world as one great
empire of capital, Smith dreams, in which trade is truly free. Then instead of individual
nations with their troublesome rules and restrictions, we would have a global free market.
Even today this remains a vision, a utopia to which the disciples of Adam Smith strive.
What is preventing its full realization? Innumerable are the obstacles that remain,
whether old-fashioned trade unions and state regulation, or the newer green groups
(“green tape”), the crusaders for social conscience, the pesky anti-capitalist movement, the
resurgence of socialism, and the interests of common people alarmed at the loss of what
they have. All the free market advocates need to do is devise ways to overcome these
annoying hindrances, and the utopia will be achieved. The catch is one characteristic of
myth: it is not that the obstacles prevent the realization of the utopia in question; rather,
the utopian myth requires those obstacles to be a myth at all. Remove the obstacles, and
the myth will lose its power. Give free market ideologues their dream, and they would
simply not know what to do with it, for the very reason for the existence of the myth
would be gone. In other words, full realization is not what the utopia of the free market
wants; instead, it wants and needs those “obstacles” (objet petit a), the constant enemies
against which the myth can be mobilized. Smith inadvertently admits as much: “To
expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain,
is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should ever be established in it.”[107]
Finally, what do we make of this effort at mythmaking, in all its mediocre verbosity?
Putting aside its ruling class apologia, the way its particularity masquerades as a
universal, and the sheer jumble of its content, we have argued that the power of W
ealth of
Nations lies in its ability to construct a myth or two. But why Smith and not one of the


many others writing on political economy at the time? Smith marks a moment of
transition, no matter how limited or temporary what follows may be. He is caught
between the explicit theological engagements of those who came before and after
(Malthus especially) and the “secular” theorists who sought to set a new path for
economic theory (such as David Ricardo and J. S. Mill). However, the transition was only
partial and temporary, for theology was never banished completely; it continues to exist
as the dialectical other of economic thought. W
e have already suggested this in relation
to Smith’s supposed “hidden” theology. It was hardly a theology worthy of the name, for
his Stoic-inspired Deism served as a classic decompression chamber from theology, a
halfway house between theology and its secular other. Therefore, we should not be
surprised that his references to the Bible are few and far between[108] and that his
concerns with religion relate only to matters of the clergy and their roles in state and
society. Furthermore, the ambiguity of the much-abused “invisible hand” marks the
transitional phase for which Smith is the prime example. That hand may be read as a
cipher for Providence, as many of his contemporaries did and as some scholars do today.
But it may also be read as a metaphor, a fully secular assertion concerning the internal
workings of that projection, the market. Both are perfectly true. As is characteristic of
transitional ideologues, they straddle both worlds, enabling alternative readings. Yet, in
doing so, they open up a passage from one to the other, for those who wish to
understand and operate in the new way. It is not for nothing that Smith is so often seen
as both the culmination of economic theories that went before and as the originator of
proper economic theory that came after.
A similar point applies to his polemic in favor of that projection, the “free market” or
“the economy.” Even though W
ealth of Nations is coded in moral terms between good
and evil actors, even though it is full of discussions of the roles of government, of
jurisprudence, warfare etc. etc. etc, Smith assumes[109] that the study of political
economy is distinct from the moral and social sciences. Again, one may read him in
both ways, either by stressing the embedded nature of political economy or by gleaning
from his work the ideas that would evolve into the staples of neoclassical economics: the
free market as an entity unto itself, with its own dynamic, all of which expresses the
fundamental features of human nature. Indeed, this is what the slogan “Adam Smith”
stands for today, rather than the dross with which his work is filled. More precisely, this
is what the myth of Adam Smith was able to achieve.

2. One of the more glaring contradictions concerns his suspicion of foreign trade and even domestic


manufacturing; he clearly prefers agriculture. Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979 [1776]), II.v.31; III.i.3; III.iv.24; IV

immediately following, he argues strenuously for a “perfectly free market” precisely in foreign trade (IV

Note also his description of any new manufacture as speculation (I.x.b.43; II.iii.26) and that the rate of profit
is reduced by speculative traders (V
.i.e.10). Even the sympathetic Viner notes the “absence of complete co-
ordination and unity” in his philosophy. Viner, Essays on the Intellectual History of Economics (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1991), 101. 
3. Apart from his lack of awareness of steam power (no parables of steam appear) or of James Watt’s other
inventions—let alone the nature of the cotton industry or of new ways of making beer—Smith also fails to
see the internal dynamic of monopolies and competition. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations, I.vi.28; I.xi.p.10.
4. Smith gives the impression of having assembled a compendium of his opinions on anything that comes to
mind. We fail to see, for instance, what a long and potted account of the roles of the clergy from the Roman
Empire onwards, or a diatribe on dissolute youth, has to do with the causes that lead to the “wealth of
nations.” Ibid., V
.i.f.18–45. Many of these features are noted by Murray Rothbard, who asks many of the
right questions but then offers woeful answers from his perspective of capitalist anarchism. Murray N.
Rothbard, An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought, vol. 1, Economic Thought Before Adam
Smith (Auburn: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2010 [1995]), 435–74. The ever polite Ricardo offers a back-
handed compliment: “If the comprehensive mind of Adam Smith had been directed to this fact, he would not
have maintained . . .” David Ricardo, The W
orks and Correspondence of David Ricardo, vol. 1, On the Principles
of Political Economy and T
axation, ed. Piero Sraffa (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004 [1817]), 329.
5. For an indication of the immediate impact and popularity of his work among the ruling class, see the brief
survey in Roy Harold Campbell and Andrew Skinner’, general introduction to Adam Smith, An Inquiry into
the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1–60 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979 [1776]), 41–
43.
6. In the western parts of Europe, the recalibration of human nature which took place in capitalism was
different in pace and nature in the areas east of the Elbe, due to the different implementation of capitalism in
these areas.

8. “As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to
reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the
grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer
only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them.” And
again: “As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of almost all the produce
which the labourer can either raise, or collect from it. Ibid., I.vi.8; I.viii.6. A poor echo of Locke may be
found in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, where Smith opines that the seizing of something—his example is an
apple—constitutes the origins of private property. Yet, private property does not really begin until the age of
agriculture in Greece and Rome, and then medieval Europe. At least that seems to be his main point, for he
contradicts himself later and suggests it appears with the previous stage of shepherds. Adam Smith, Lectures
on Jurisprudence (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1982 [1976]), 55–56, 59–71, 191, 393–94.
9. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, I.ii.2.
10. Ibid., I.ii.1. Elsewhere he speaks of the “the natural inclinations of man,” assuming this initial slogan (III.i.3;
see also II.i.2).
11. Our argument need not examine the interminable debates over das Adam Smith Problem, that is, whether
Smith changed his mind between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and Wealth of Nations, or whether his


thought is consistent between the two. Debate turns on whether the former is more socially oriented (with its
theory of sympathy), or whether they both promote self-interest.
12. Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, I.i.5.
13. Schumpeter notes drily: “No woman, except for his mother, ever played a role in his existence: in this as in
other respects the glamors and passions of life were just literature to him.” Joseph Schumpeter, A History of
Economic Analysis (London: Routledge, 2006), 177. As for sex, we have been able to find only these
references in Wealth of Nations: “Poverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent
marriage. It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved Highland woman frequently bears
more than twenty children, while a pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is
generally exhausted by two or three. Barrenness, so frequent among women of fashion, is very rare among
those of inferior station. Luxury in the fair sex, while it enflames perhaps the passion for enjoyment, seems
always to weaken, and frequently to destroy altogether, the powers of generation”; “The chairmen, porters,
and coalheavers in London, and those unfortunate women who live by prostitution, the strongest men and
the most beautiful women perhaps in the British dominions, are said to be, the greater part of them, from the
lowest rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed with this root. No food can afford a more decisive
proof of its nourishing quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution”;
“Mercantile stock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing stock.” The final quotation may,
perhaps, be taken as a comment on Smith’s own approach to sex. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations, I.viii.37; I.xi.41; IV
.ix.11.

what is the tone of temper, and tenour of conduct, which constitutes the excellent and praise-worthy
character, the character which is the natural object of esteem, honour, and approbation? And, secondly, by
what power or faculty in the mind is it, that this character, whatever it be, is recommended to us? Or in other
words, how and by what means does it come to pass, that the mind prefers one tenour of conduct to
another?” Ibid., VII.i.2.

25. Sedlacek and Foley miss Smith’s effort at recoding. They mistakenly assume that Smith always saw self-
interest as an evil that resulted in social virtue. This assumption enables Foley to argue that Smith suggests,
but does not prove, that the concrete evil of self-interest results in the abstract good of social benefit.
However, at a deeper level, we remain profoundly suspicious of ethics and moral philosophy as components


of ruling class ideology. Sedlacek, Economics of Good and Evil: The Quest for Economic Meaning from

abandoned by God is tentative, ambivalent, and often short-lived. God may at any time reappear—to extend

40. Needless to say, critics simply miss the mythic nature of Smith’s work. For instance, Aspromourgos does not
see that the comprehensive “framework” produced by Smith is a result of his mythic production, within
which neoclassical and neoliberal economists remain in thrall. Aspromourgos, The Science of Wealth: Adam
Smith and the Framing of Political Economy.

47. Ibid., III.iv.3. It is worth noting here the tension between this moral tale and the parable of the industrious
farmer: “Not only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations of husbandry, but many
inferior branches of country labour require much more skill and experience than the greater part of
mechanick trades. The man who works upon brass and iron, works with instruments and upon materials of
which the temper is always the same, or very nearly the same. But the man who ploughs the ground with a
team of horses or oxen, works with instruments of which the health, strength, and temper are very different
upon different occasions. The condition of the materials which he works upon too is as variable as that of the
instruments which he works with, and both require to be managed with much judgment and discretion. The
common ploughman, though generally regarded as the pattern of stupidity and ignorance, is seldom
defective in this judgment and discretion.” Ibid., I.x.c.24.

four stages late in Wealth of Nations, in the rambling treatments of war and law. Apart from contradictions
with the foundation myth, the economic features of the stages that appear in the Lectures on Jurisprudence
have been excised. Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, V
.i.a–b. Therefore,
efforts to identify a four-stage theory throughout Wealth of Nations forces the text into places it does not
wish to go.

74. The shift is by no means complete in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, for a little later he reasserts his initial
position: “A rude and barbarous people are ignorant of the effects of the division of labour, and it is long
before one person, by continualy working at different things, can produce any more than is necessary for his
daily subsistence . . . in a nation of hunters or shepherds no person can quit the common trade in which he is
employed, and which affords him daily subsistence, till he have some stock to maintain him and begin the
new trade . . . Bare subsistence is almost all that a savage can procure, and having no stock to begin upon,
nothing to maintain him but what is produced by the exertion of his own strength, it is no wonder that he
continues long in an indigent state.” Smith, Lectures on Jurisprudence, 444.

further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the
labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard
in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is in reality the chearful and the
hearty state to all the different orders of the society. The stationary is dull; the declining, melancholy.” Ibid.,

is the peculiar claim to originality of English exceptionalism that has made this surge the real basis of
capitalism. For an excellent analysis that debunks the peculiarity of English industrialization, see Immanuel
Wallerstein, The Modern W
orld-System III: The Second Era of Great Expansion of the Capitalist W

97. Smith makes no effort to conceal his class affiliation, as his characterizations of workers make clear. We offer a
couple of examples among many: “The torpor of his mind renders him, not only incapable of relishing or
bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and
consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life.”
Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, V
.i.f.50. “It is remarkable that in every
commercial nation the low people are exceedingly stupid. The Dutch vulgar are eminently so, and the
English are more so than the Scotch.” Smith, Lectures on Jurisprudence, 459. Compare those comments with
his depiction of a ruling class intellectual: “The contemplation of so great a variety of objects necessarily
exercises their minds in endless comparisons and combinations, and renders their understandings, in an
extraordinary degree, both acute and comprehensive. Unless those few, however, happen to be placed in
some very particular situations, their great abilities, though honourable to themselves, may contribute very
little to the good government or happiness of their society. Notwithstanding the great abilities of those few,
all the nobler parts of the human character may be, in a great measure, obliterated and extinguished in the
great body of the people.” Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, V
.i.f.51; see
also V
.ii.k.7. He shared this class position with nearly all political economists, apart from Marx. Ricardo, of
course, follows suit and is even harsher on the working poor. Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy

axation, 106–9.

scrutiny to be conjectural, contradictory, irrelevant, or inconclusive, the rightness of his argument, the power
