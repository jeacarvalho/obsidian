Conclusion
W
e have focused on four key figures in the development of what eventually became
classical economic thought: Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Thomas Malthus, and Adam
Smith. Rather than engage in a grand survey of the genre known as the “History of
Economic Thought,” we have chosen to dig a little deeper into the work of these four. As
we began this project, we had a reasonable idea of certain key developments: that the
Bible was important for Grotius and Locke, perhaps even Malthus; that debate swirled
around the ambiguities of “theology” in the work of Adam Smith; that theology was
sublated at a particular (although debated) moment, a sublation that set in motion a
troubled period of secularization; and that the economics imperialism of today relies on a
dialectical process of individualization, de-socialization, and de-historicization, a
process that enables a curious imperialist universal precisely because of this reductionism.
However, we were genuinely surprised at the unexpected features revealed through
close readings of their texts. To begin with, classical economic theory turns out to have
been wrested from the Fall. This biblical narrative is a crucial component in the thought
of Grotius, Locke, and Malthus; it even troubles Smith at a deeper, formal level. More
precisely, strenuous efforts to negotiate the more troublesome aspects of the Fall take
center stage in their work. These were the curses of Gen. 3:14-19, which contain the
clear statements that as a result of disobedience the first human beings were made to labor
for their daily bread. In the case of Grotius and Locke, they tried to sidestep the obvious
implications of these texts, seeking ways to justify private property and then labor,
especially the use of labor by others, as parts of the divine will, as results of the command
in Gen. 1:28 to be fruitful and multiply. The reason is obvious: it would hardly be
appropriate if the cornerstones of a still nascent mode of production—capitalism—were
the results of a divine curse, a manifestation of the fallen nature of human beings. Only
Malthus, for all his faults, was willing to face up to that sinful nature, although he saw it
as a paradox of goodness. Through the divine and therefore good gifts of sexual desire
and the need for subsistence, the paradox of evil emerges: misery and vice seem to be a
result of divine goodness. Here, Malthus skirts risky theological territory: he has
glimpsed the stark theological position in which evil is itself the dialectical outcome of
goodness, of God’s gifts to the world. Despite his desperate efforts at back-pedaling, at


falling back on moral sanctions in his later revisions of the essay on population, Malthus
presents in spite of himself a strong doctrine of evil. It comprises a fresh breeze in the
stifling and banal assumptions of the innate goodness of human beings. And this from
the one whom Marx called the sycophant of the aristocracy!
Closely related to the concern with the Fall, another surprise awaited us, namely, the
obsessive concern with human nature. W
e should have expected this, for these writers
were philosophers for whom jurisprudence (Grotius) and theology (Grotius, Locke, and
Malthus) were necessary adjuncts. In addition, they found themselves part of larger
debates that ranged between Hobbes’s grim view and the breezily positive position of a
natural benevolence characteristic of Hutcheson and others. Yet here we found a
contradictory situation, for the more they asserted the universality of human nature, the
more they indicated the extent to which human nature was changing. In particular,
Grotius and Locke resorted to, and struggled with, the very same biblical text (Genesis 1–
3) as they wrestled with the question of human nature. Since God had created human
beings, the sure indication of human nature was to be found in the biblical account of
that first man (but implicitly not the woman). The catch was that the image of the man
presented there did not suit their agendas, so they scratched about for other texts that did.
Genesis 1:28 became important, for in carrying out God’s command to subdue the earth
and fill it, the realities of labor and property naturally ensued. As we argued, this
obsessive stress on human nature may be seen as a signal of the changes under way in
that nature. The tendrils of what would come to be called capitalism were spreading ever
further into daily life, with the reorganization of time, the spread of the wage relation,
and the need to foster widespread acquisitiveness. In this light, avarice and greed had to
be recoded as self-interest or self-love (initially balanced by beneficence); labor had to be
reconceived as “free” rather than bonded; and the usury and acquisition of the ruling
class had to become interest and profit. Interpreting the human condition as fallen was
unacceptable, as was the idea that the results of the Fall—labor, property, interest, and
profit—needed to be overcome with redemption. Another feature of this emphasis on
human nature was its universalizing logic. For Grotius and Locke, what God had
ordained was by definition universal. So they sought to reconfigure God’s will in
creation. Adam Smith was then able to pick up this universalizing logic and drop the
struggle with biblical texts, infamously asserting that it is human nature to truck, barter,
and exchange. Once again, Malthus represents the most intriguing figure on the matter
of human nature, for he reasserts the fallen nature of human beings and thereby troubles
the more benign approaches of Grotius, Locke, and Smith.


The third surprise was a consistent reworking of what can only be called the
foundation myth of capitalism. To our knowledge, this myth has been analyzed in a
rudimentary fashion only with regard to Adam Smith,[1] but it has not received sustained
attention in the writings of the others. So we found Grotius at work in constructing the
myth, as also Locke, both of them doing so in their struggle with Genesis 1–3.[2] In the
hands of Adam Smith, the myth appears to lose its biblical sparring partner, but the very
act of producing a myth, as also in the tensions between narratives of difference and of
identity, places him in the same tradition. In its Smithian formulation, that myth recurs
in the work of others at the time, including David Ricardo, J. S. Mill, and Malthus (in his
Principles).[3] More than that, myth becomes a necessary generic feature, appearing early
in often voluminous studies, thereby attempting to set the scene with some “historical”
narrative. W
e also discovered Smith to be the great storyteller, who resorts to a vignette,
moral tale, saying, parable, and above all myth in the place of actual argument. Rarely, if
ever, does critical work deal with such myths. By failing to do so, the narrative structures,
the plot lines, and the function of myth are overlooked in the development of their
theories. W
e defined myth’s function in terms of its capacity to foreground and attempt
to resolve contradictions, to create opponents (usually racial, but also gendered and class-
based), and to express a deeper truth. On that last point, the dialectical tension of myth is
that it bears the conflicting senses of fiction and alternative truth, both of which are
evident in the continually reworked myth of capitalism and its economic theory. As we
argued, the truth in this case is the need to create a new and autonomous entity—“the
economy” or “the market”—in a manner comparable to the method by which theology
creates its objects of analysis.[4] Another truth lies in the production of the market-
utopia, which finds its fullest expression in Smith’s work. Or rather, the truth here is that
the myth never really seeks the realization of that utopia, but prefers to focus on the
necessary opponents it creates—those who continue to hinder the supposed realization
and may, therefore, be sacrificed for the sake of a condition that will never exist. But this
myth also offers an account that is thoroughly resistant to empirical counters; in its very
language of metaphor, image, and in its narrative patterns, it provides a foundation story,
a story to live by that continues to provide the ideological glue for capitalism. No matter
how many economic crashes ensue, how many wars are fought for the sake of capital
gain, how many environmental disasters are wrought, how many deaths follow in its
wake, how many societies and cultures are destroyed—the myth sustains the enterprise.
All for the sake of a market utopia whose proponents would run in terror should it ever be
achieved.


A fourth feature of our analysis was the consistent presence of what we call the
universal by exclusion. This false universal is already found in the struggles and
assertions concerning human nature, but it also turns up in Grotius’s blunt logic
concerning subjective rights (as private property) and slavery; in Locke’s limitations of
freedom in relation to children, society, race, and women (as Pateman argued); and in the
increasing racism of the ethnocentric proposals of Smith and Malthus. In each case, the
logic is inescapably similar: a claim concerning “all” must define the boundaries of that
“all,” must exclude the majority from the universal claim. On this matter, we drew from
Domenico Losurdo’s analysis of liberalism. It is not merely the case that nascent
liberalism imperfectly claimed freedom and equality for all; that it asserted human beings
naturally engage in trucking, bartering, and exchanging; and that it claimed private
property was a natural right of all. According to this understanding, the slogans were
correct, but they still await their full realization. They are, if you will, ideals to which
human society strives. For Losurdo, liberalism must exclude the majority, even if it needs
to shift the location of that majority. In the cases of Grotius, Locke, Smith, and Malthus,
the “all” is limited to the men of a certain class in European colonial centers. W
omen need
not bother—nor need slaves, children, and the “savage” and “barbarian” people that
swarm over the globe. In all this, Locke inadvertently reveals this necessary logic of
liberalism in his struggles over the relationship between the state of nature and civilized
society. As we argued, it is difficult to find anyone in Locke’s analysis who is completely
free and equal, with full rights to private property. Like the mythical serpent, the Egyptian
and Greek Ouroboros, liberalism ultimately consumes itself.
All this should reveal the lie of economics imperialism—the claim that the basic
principles of economics determine the actions of all human beings. That is, how do
human beings seek to better their own condition in a situation of scarcity? Here self-
interest as an unwitting social good comes into play, as do comparative advantage in
decision making and the ultimate rationality of the choices we make. Here, too, we
encounter the assertion of the basic principle of equilibrium when that curious creation,
the market, is left to itself. Ultimately, all decisions are economic decisions, or so the
economics imperialists would have us believe. These basic criteria can then be applied
freely to just about anything, including psychology, culture, and religion. Thus, religion
becomes a marketplace that influences individual choices and institutional developments.
The problem with this imperialism should be clear: the chronic specificity of the creation
of these theories indicates that they are far from universal—that they are anything but
human nature for all.


W
e would like to add another dimension to this argument. As we indicated in the
introduction, it derives from the dialectical process explored in the work of Fine and
Milonakis. Thus, the necessary precursor to economics imperialism was the gradual
process in classical and neoclassical economic theory of focusing on the private
individual by removing not only the social and historical conditions of such an
individual, but also by denying the conditions of that theory itself—in short,
indivualization, de-socialization, and de-historicization. This means not merely that the
initial social, political, and juridical concerns of the classical economists were gradually
stripped down to produce a “scientific” discipline festooned with mathematical formulae
that studied the given data of economic life—or, as W
allerstein puts it, economics took
the form of a university discipline in which “the W
estern world studied itself, explained
its own functioning, the better to control what was happening.”[5] It also means that the
process of reductionism was necessary for the claim to universal status of its
propositions, a tendency already noticeable in Adam Smith. Only when one has
suppressed all the signs of the specificity of one’s discipline does it become possible to
claim a universal status. That is, reductionism is the prerequisite of this type of
universalism. It may also be called an imperialist universal: all the world is the same as us,
since we control that world.
Our contribution to this sharp analysis of economics imperialism—which Fine and
Milonakis see emerging in full form only in the 1980s with the supposed “rolling back”
of communism—is to indicate that economics imperialism also required an apparent de-
biblicization. While the Bible was central for Grotius and Locke (as well as Pufendorf,
Hobbes, and a host of lesser lights), it hardly appears in the works of Smith, Ricardo, or J.
S. Mill. Biblical authority seemed to lose the hold it had on earlier thinkers, to the extent
that one no longer needed to engage with the Bible in developing positions on
economics, law
, government, and so on. There is nothing remarkable about this, for the
formation of distinct intellectual disciplines initially involved an adolescent rebellion
against the tutelage of biblical authority, mediated by the church, followed by a maturity
in which the disciplines in question claimed their independence.[6] The forms of
analysis may still contain traces of that earlier dependence, but the content has been well
and truly discarded. W
e would add that in the place of God—or of the church that had
abandoned the child on its path to maturity—each discipline found it necessary to
project another being in its place, a topic of analysis that claimed to be the world as it is.
For economics, this was “the economy.” However, pushing this analysis further, we
would like to point out that the process of de-biblicization was another dimension of the


long process of reduction, to be added to the process of individualization, de-
socialization, and de-historicization traced by Fine and Milonakis. The Bible, too, once
formed a distinctly specific mark of the emergence of classical economics, a clear signal
of the particular social, historical, and ideological moment. When the particular biblical
nature of those earlier debates had been excised from analysis, as so many quirky
concerns of the critics in question, the specific conclusions they had attained could
gradually be universalized with a calm and rather astonishing ignorance concerning the
nature of that origin. In other words, de-biblicization contributed in its own way to
provide the basis for the economics materialism of today. So we find it rather ironic that
economics imperialism claims to provide ways of analyzing religion, theology, and the
Bible (among many other targets) with supposedly universal questions that actually
arose in struggles over biblical texts.
Yet, it would be a mistake to see this reading as yet another version of the narrative of
secularization. W
e have Malthus to thank for troubling such an effort, which is one of
the reasons we ended our discussion with him. He is less a relic of an earlier age and
more of reminder that the conventional and linear model of secularization does not stand
up to scrutiny. What does Malthus mean for the conventional understanding of
secularization, especially considering the strong doctrine of evil embodied in his
Christological emphasis on propitiatory atonement? W
e suggest that his specific
contribution may be seen as a signal that any moment of secularization is partial and
tentative, impermanent, and dialectically related to its religious other. The tentative nature
of the secularization of economic theory may easily be seen in the conflicting efforts to
identify precisely when it took place. Did it begin somewhere between Locke and Smith,
only to be fully realized at some point between the early-nineteenth-century and the end
of the First W
orld W
ar?[7] The impermanence of the process shows up in the constant
tendency of religion to reassert its presence in debates. It may surface in Malthus, who
comes after the transitional work of Smith, or even in Viner in the 1970s, or in the recent
spate of looser efforts to analyze the religious dimension of economic theory. Each
manifestation leads to a more dialectical approach in the patterns of secularization and
desecularization (following the inspiration of Marx), in which the former is an effort to
deal with the contradictions generated by a religious framework, only to produce a new
set of problems at another level that, in turn, require a period in which religion returns in
an effort to deal with those problems. So we find waves of secularization that may wash
over a culture for a time, only to recede once again in the face of explicit engagements
with religion in a way that indicates neither process is irreversible. A dialectical reading
