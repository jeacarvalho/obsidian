Their health insurance costs were astronomical, making it impossible for some churches to pay for a full-time pastor with health benefits.

This is the only existing self-reported longitudinal data set of clergy health, which allows us to see how individual clergy do over time.

Irenaeus says “the glory of God is a human being fully alive.”

Rae Jean’s work documents these fractures clearly. So where’s the problem in our gospel? How is the thing that is supposed to make us fully alive actually making less of us?

[[mudança de contexto gera estresse]]

Working long hours when one is energized in ministry is not necessarily a problem. What does seem to be a problem is when pastors feel like they can’t ever take a break from ministry work or when they feel [[culpa por não fazer o suficiente]]

Note | Page: 3

Pastors working in poor areas, whether rural or urban, face extra pressure from the economic stagnation, resource-deprived schools, and lack of hope for the future experienced by their parishioners.

In many small churches, there’s a lot of stress. I came out of working in a company with a $7-million-dollar budget and a number of people that I was in charge of, and I did not have the pressure and stress that’s on me in the ministry of three churches.


Note | Page: 7

It was the right thing to do, and doing the right but potentially costly thing is called [[liderança]].


Note | Page: 8

I could have 5 percent of people unhappy with me and it would ruin my day. Mais uma vez, [[culpa por não fazer o suficiente]]


Note | Page: 13

It’s really, really hard to get fired in church. Because people in chairs like mine are often cowards. We want to be liked above all else, so we’d rather bear with subpar performance than take the heat that comes from firing someone. We’re wrong to do this, as I hope you can tell my description here implies. “We’re commanded to love people—not to employ them,” a wise older friend says. [[igreja é lugar de amar não necessariamente de empregar]]

Note | Page: 18

One study suggests that clergy are rather unique in the wide range of emotions they experience.


Note | Page: 21

Seasoned pastors have always spied pastoral wisdom in these stories: the people we lead will turn on us, and we will turn on them. Power can be dangerous—especially if we’re momentarily in our parishioners’ good favor. Things can turn in an instant, and we can be on the run for our lives.

[[teoria da santificação]]

Sanctification theory proposes that when someone gives sacred meaning to something, they exert substantial energy and time for it, fiercely protect it, experience strong emotions around it, draw on it as a resource, and experience desolation if it is lost.

Note | Page: 24

When your work is sacred, sanctification theory suggests that you will exert extra energy to do it.

Note | Page: 24

When work is sacred, clergy might end up with a default approach in which everything is equally important, meaning that they are more likely to overwork and, at the same time, less likely to take care of their own physical and mental health.


Note | Page: 25

Another implication of doing sacred work is that the stakes of perceived failure are higher for clergy than for other workers.

Note | Page: 26

Before you confront me or another clergy person this way, pray. Pray afterward too. Ask others to pray with you. Encourage a lot; correct a little.

[[aprender com os nãos, como a mulher que insistiu com Jesus]]
Be like the Syrophoenician woman who heard a harsh criticism from none other than [[Jesus]] himself in Mark 7:25–30 (can you imagine?). She perseveres and receives the healing she seeks for her daughter. Martin Luther points out the obvious: Jesus says no to her. Yet, Luther says, there is a yes hidden in the no.15 She persists until she finds it. So we should do with criticism, however harsh—even a no from our Lord. Push through it and find the yes that’s also there. And you’ll be blessed, the dead will be raised, and the kingdom will come.

When several demands are competing for your attention, especially demands that you consider important, it’s easy to feel anxious.

[[a fé prática abre mão do controle teórico]]
“Clergy want and like control. You are supposed to feel peace because God is in control. Pastors are well trained from a theological perspective to say that they have no control. Still, people want pastors to be in control.”

Note | Page: 28

When Abram, Moses, and Mary were called by God, they gladly yielded control of their lives—and it didn’t always turn out altogether well for them. Yet their surrender of agency brought about God’s saving work through them.

Note | Page: 29

Discipleship is a matter of surrendering control to an Other who we think will handle it better than we could.

Note | Page: 32

clergy exhibit less [[burnout]] than police officers and emergency personnel; similar [[burnout]] to social workers and teachers; and worse [[burnout]] than counselors.

The World Health Organization ranks depression as the leading cause of disability, with worldwide estimates of 350 million people having experienced depression in the past year.

Note | Page: 38

Nationally and internationally, women generally have higher rates of depression than men.16 It’s very interesting that this pattern is not true for clergy.

Note | Page: 39

Is it possible that depressed young men seek healing in the church? As a response to depression, this would be quite healthy! And then could it be, with more time spent in the church, some portion of these young men with prior depression are noticed as having gifts in ministry and are encouraged to consider ministerial careers—more so than young men who don’t have depression and therefore didn’t seek healing in the church in the same numbers? Or is it possible that young men with depression who seek solace in the church have a different church experience and feel more called than young men who don’t seek solace in the church for depression?

Note | Page: 39

What would have happened to the mental health of clergy had they entered a different profession? Is it possible that working in ministry is protective against depression? Yes, clergy have high depression rates, but maybe those rates would be even higher if clergy weren’t engaged in work that they find meaningful.

[[ministério pastoral entrega a outros o resultado de minhas lutas pessoais]]
If we ministers have anything to offer another person, it is usually mediated through our pain. This doesn’t mean turning the pulpit into an opportunity to avoid paying therapists—we have to work out our personal pain on our own, not in our sermons or pastoral care. But if we’re aware of where and how it hurts in us and how we’ve traveled spiritually in response to that hurt, we can help others in response to theirs.

Note | Page: 44

[[vida humana não é buca por prazer mas por significado]]
Viktor Frankl. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, largely about his experience in the Nazi death camps, Frankl concludes that his fellow psychoanalysts are wrong. Human life is not a search for pleasure, as Sigmund Freud premised. It is not based on power, as Alfred Adler and [[Nietzsche]] and others said. Human life is fundamentally a search for meaning. Frankl observed that those who found meaning in their suffering, despite whatever the vile intentions of its inflictors were, disproportionately survived.

Note | Page: 44

“The one who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.”27 This is not to diminish the suffering of six million murdered—far from it. It is to say that living for a meaningful purpose, sub specie aeternitatis (in light of eternity), as Frankl puts it, is a powerful, nearly deathless way to live.

Note | Page: 45

To go back to Rohr: what we do not transform, we transmit. We have to do something with our pain or we will inflict it on others.

Note | Page: 45

Rohr again: “If we don’t learn to mythologize our lives, inevitably we will pathologize them.”

Note | Page: 46

Ultimately, you try to get rid of all unimportant and meaningless activities. And it’s been shown to work, in the most rigorous studies and even with people who are experiencing poverty and homelessness.31 I’m not saying it’s easy—it’s actually especially hard to feel something is meaningful when you are experiencing the hopeless fog of depression. But it’s a powerful start.

Note | Page: 47

occupational health theory called effort-reward imbalance theory.33 It’s a pretty straightforward theory: if the effort you put in is greater than the reward you get back, it will lead to emotional distress.

Note | Page: 48

Christian clergy think differently about “control” than a lot of secular research on control suggests. Many studies find that having greater perceived control relates to better mental health.35 In contrast, through interviewing clergy I found that they try to seek God’s way and that they can feel unfaithful if they try to wrench control their way.

Note | Page: 48

The strongest relationships with depression in clergy were job stress and feeling guilty about not doing enough.

Note | Page: 48

Pastors who scored higher on life unpredictability, social isolation, doubting their call, and financial stress were more likely to qualify for depression.

Note | Page: 50

Ministers are sent places to lead, and leading often includes making changes. We know that the best things about the church will never change: Jesus, the Scriptures, and serving our community. But sometimes church folks get confused and think nothing should ever change: the carpet, the meeting times, or the worship style. Many lay people paying the church’s bills—often older people—didn’t ask for change. They’d rather things stay just the way they are, thank you.

Note | Page: 50

And leading, including making changes, can feel risky in an environment where fewer Americans go to church. With many mainline churches closing, the pressure to grow church congregations is very real.


Note | Page: 51

To compare ourselves unfavorably to other pastors is just one step away from doubting our call and feeling guilty for not doing enough—two things related to depression in pastors.

Note | Page: 51

Theologian Lauren Winner speaks of an art critic, Peter Schjeldahl, who has a strategy for responding to a work he hates. Winner writes, “He asks himself, What would I like about this if I liked it?”40 We can ask this even of mean-hearted criticism. There is always an opportunity to learn and grow. Your allies will be heartened by your willingness to accept a strange gift—and your enemies will be discouraged that they accidentally made you a better pastor.

Note | Page: 52

Discern your call. Discern where your efforts are most needed—where God is calling you to be—and do that thing with all you have. Don’t feel guilty about not doing enough.

Note | Page: 52

[[se estamos trabalhando alinhados a Deus isto deve ser o suficiente]]
If you are working in alignment with God, then it will have to be enough. You don’t need to save the church by dying yourself. Christ’s sacrifice is unrepeatable.


Note | Page: 54

[[o que importa é a vitória de Cristo, já consumada, e não a minha vitória]]
In Christ, the victory that matters has already been won. Our work is then surprisingly free to succeed or fail or tread along just below standard. God will bring about the world God wants, either with our help or despite us or through us. Hang on tightly to meaning.

Stress implies something negative, but viewed objectively, a situation just is. It’s the reaction to those circumstances—which varies from person to person—that is either positive or negative.

Note | Page: 62

Circumstances that aren’t difficult and aren’t important to you don’t create strong emotions, positive or negative. If you view a circumstance as beneficial and not difficult, that may lead to positive emotions like pleasure or relief.

Note | Page: 63

Jesus embraced challenges during difficult circumstances. At the same time, not every challenge you encounter can be turned into a positive growth experience. However, if you can find a way to think about some challenging circumstances as making you and the body of Christ stronger, this will make all the difference in terms of circumventing stress symptoms instead of experiencing them.

Note | Page: 66

[[enfrentamento focado na emoção]]
In emotion-focused coping, the goal is to try to reduce the negative emotions you’re experiencing.17 You might talk with a friend or write in a journal. Just expressing your strong emotions might make them less strong.

Note | Page: 68

When engaged in emotion-focused coping, telling your problems to others can help relieve the sense of burden and make you feel less alone, even if no new ideas or insights come from it.

Note | Page: 76

You have to do something to bring about positive emotions that will help you relax; otherwise you will stay tense and those stress symptoms will continue. You have to learn how to celebrate, how to let go. Consider putting in place a regular ritual that induces this relaxation response.

The causes of obesity are more complicated than just eating and exercise. Looking at the reasons why someone eats too many calories, we often find that stress is involved. If you’ve ever been stressed and reached for carbs and dessert, there’s a biological reason. Under stress, your body secretes more glucocorticoid hormone, which leads you to want to eat more carbs and energy-dense food.
