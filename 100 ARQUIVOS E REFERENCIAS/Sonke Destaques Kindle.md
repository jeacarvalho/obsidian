[[Anotar de forma consistente vai me levar a um futuro melhor]]

To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic
LOCATION: 158

What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand ([[Duckworth]] and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).
LOCATION: 166

It is not so important who you are, but what you do.
LOCATION: 169

Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.
LOCATION: 178

it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas.
LOCATION: 246

The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level.
LOCATION: 251

Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads to drive it on.
LOCATION: 264

Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998).
LOCATION: 381

Rarely would a note stay in isolation.
LOCATION: 430

Writing that an author struggles in one chapter to justify his method can be a much more adequate description of this chapter’s content than any quote from the text itself
LOCATION: 433

The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers.
LOCATION: 435

We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.
LOCATION: 457

Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is.
LOCATION: 491

Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.
LOCATION: 494

If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics,
LOCATION: 496

If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.
LOCATION: 502

Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes.
LOCATION: 505

1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.
LOCATION: 510

2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content.
LOCATION: 516

3. Make permanent notes.
LOCATION: 520

The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
LOCATION: 523

4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:
LOCATION: 528

a)    Filing each one behind one or more related notes
LOCATION: 530

b)    Adding links to related notes.
LOCATION: 534

c)    Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index
LOCATION: 536

5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system.
LOCATION: 539

Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it.
LOCATION: 544

6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.
LOCATION: 548

7. Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent
LOCATION: 555

As the only way to find out if something is worth reading is by reading it (even just bits of it), it makes sense to use the time spent in the best possible way.
LOCATION: 568

Each added bit of information, filtered only by our interest, is a contribution to our future understanding, thinking and writing.
LOCATION: 581

Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research.
LOCATION: 702

If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.
LOCATION: 719

Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus.
LOCATION: 729

You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. [[Deliberate practice ]]is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008).
LOCATION: 735

In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?
LOCATION: 787

The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
LOCATION: 796

the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep.
LOCATION: 834

Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.
LOCATION: 844

Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
LOCATION: 848

the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two.
LOCATION: 851

The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box.
LOCATION: 854

Luhmann never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: “I make a note with the bibliographic details. On the backside I would write ‘on page x is this, on page y is that,’ and then it goes into the bibliographic slip-box where I collect everything I read.”
LOCATION: 856

In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.
LOCATION: 864

The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing.
LOCATION: 947

If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing.
LOCATION: 957

When it finally comes to the decision on what to write about, you will already have made the decision – because you made it on every single step along the way, again and again every day, improving it gradually. Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the right topic, you will spend your time actually working on your already existing interests and doing what is necessary to make informed decisions – reading, thinking and writing.
LOCATION: 974

Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do.
NOTE: Endergonic reaction
LOCATION: 1007

Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding).
LOCATION: 1014

Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. Being open for feedback doesn’t help very much if the only feedback you can get comes once every few months for work you have already finished.
LOCATION: 1022

Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words.
LOCATION: 1031

But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.
LOCATION: 1038

The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions. While these built-in feedback loops do not make redundant the feedback from your peers or supervisor, they are the only ones that are always available and can help us to improve a little bit, multiple times every single day.
LOCATION: 1043

The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle.
LOCATION: 1048

Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information.
LOCATION: 1056

We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.
LOCATION: 1108

It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.
LOCATION: 1115

The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other.
LOCATION: 1128

If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text.
LOCATION: 1146

We need to get our thoughts on paper first and improve them there, where we can look at them.
LOCATION: 1152

Working with the slip-box means playing with ideas and looking out for interesting connections and comparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clusters and preparing the order of notes for a project.
LOCATION: 1166

Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them.
LOCATION: 1179

“On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both … The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152)
LOCATION: 1184

To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan.
LOCATION: 1189

An) exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement in human performance because of analytical rationality’s slow reasoning and its emphasis on rules, principles, and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise.” (Flyvbjerg 2001, 15)
LOCATION: 1199

An expert in academic writing has a feel for the process, an acquired intuition for which task will bring one closer to the finished manuscript and what is only a distraction.
LOCATION: 1212

According to the Dreyfuses, the correct application of teachable rules enables you to become a competent “performer” (which corresponds to a “3” on their five-grade expert scale), but it won’t make you a “master” (level 4) and certainly won’t turn you into an “expert” (level 5).
LOCATION: 1236

This is why it is so much easier to remember things we understand than things we don’t. It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning or understanding. It is always about understanding – and if it is only for the sake of learning. Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.
LOCATION: 1280

Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse.
LOCATION: 1347

By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. That leaves us with much more mental energy that we can direct towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems in question.
LOCATION: 1358

To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.
LOCATION: 1379

Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words
LOCATION: 1398

You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.
LOCATION: 1431

Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one’s own words.
LOCATION: 1444

keep in mind that it is all about the essence, the understanding and preparation for the next step – the transferring of ideas into the context of your own lines of thoughts in the slip-box.
LOCATION: 1451

This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong.
LOCATION: 1488

We should be able to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome the most surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, even better, because it brings our project forward.
LOCATION: 1491

Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to:   ·    Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read, ·    Make sure we have given a true account of its content ·    Find the relevance of it and make connections.
LOCATION: 1493

the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections.
NOTE: Importante, muito importante. Algo é importante se desenvolve o "debate" dentro do slip-box, a partir do que já está lá. Ou se cria novas possibilidades. Se conecta ou está aberto à conexão
LOCATION: 1503

What we are looking for are facts and information that can add something and therefore enrich the slip-box.
LOCATION: 1505

Collecting only one-sided ideas wouldn’t be very enriching. Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant or irrelevant.
LOCATION: 1509

dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box, while mere confirming data does not.
NOTE: Talvez a o critério seja: consigo destruir esse argumento? Tenho outros argumentos ou fatos importantes que são "maiores" do que o argumento inicial. Talvez seja assim o melhor processo de adquirir conhecimento. Começo com "comer mais proteína é melhor do que comer mais carboidrato", e com alguns fatos sobre essa afirmação. Mas enquanto leio (qualquer coisa) o desejo maior não é afirmar isso mas desconstruir. Aquilo que ficar em pé, depois de muita "força" contra, deve ser a [[verdade]].
LOCATION: 1510

It is so much easier to develop an interesting text from a lively discussion with a lot of pros and cons than from a collection of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes.
LOCATION: 1515

The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes.
LOCATION: 1518

what philosopher Immanuel [[Kant]] described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.”
NOTE: IMaturidade é a falta de habilidade de usar seu próprio conhecimento e julgamento sem que outro esteja de tutorando no processo. É ter coragem de assumir o risco de emitir uma opinião, tomar uma decisão, partir para uma ação a partir de você mesmo, daquilo que sabe, da tua [[experiência]]. É claro que somos imaturos em algum momento da vida. E é claro que somos imaturos em algum assunto em qualquer momento da vida. Alguns nunca deixaremos de ser. Me pergunte se o cirurgião deve usar um tipo ou outro de bisturi. Me dê informações sobre as opções. E, mesmo assim, eu ainda vou preferir esperar que o próprio cirurgião decida. Mas temos que amadurecer em diversos aspectos da vida, principalmente na própria [[arte de viver]].
LOCATION: 1539

One has to read extremely selectively and extract widespread and connected references. One has to be able to follow recurrences.
LOCATION: 1548

Probably the best method is to take notes – not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text.
LOCATION: 1549

Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn’t be able to put our knowledge to use.
NOTE: OLhar a partir de outra perspectiva, fazer novas perguntas, questionar as próprias perguntas antigas.. Eis o caminho
LOCATION: 1562

Permanent notes, too, are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. The only difference is that the audience here consists of our future selves, which will very soon have reached the same state of ignorance as someone who never had access to what we have written about.
NOTE: Excelente: escrever as notas permanentes, as que irão compor o slip-box, é como falar para uma audiência que não conhece aquele texto - ou pelo menos, não conhece mais: vc mesmo, depois de ter lido. Seja um dia, um mês, um ano depois, vc será um desconhecedor do que leu. Quanto tenho me visto assim. Vários livros lidos e desconhecedor do que está lá. Só retorno lá se minhas anotações realmente me ajudarem. Não adianta apenas sublinhar. Nem mesmo, como tenho feito, um "índice" com aquilo que sublinhei em minhas palavras. Isso ajuda muito. Já é muito mais do que antes. Mas eu tenho que pegar aquele "índice", minhas palavras sobre uma citação que sublinhei, e escrever de forma mais clara e completa, colocando a "nova" nota, então, no slip-box: conectando ao que já está lá, e se tornando nova possibilidade de conexão ao que vier depois. Acho que isso pode ser um bom resumo de todo esse processo.Só preciso começar! (20201027)
LOCATION: 1572

While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form.
LOCATION: 1585

NOTE: Só nos testando podemos avaliar se realmente entendemos. E o processo ajuda:a) Escrever uma nota suscinta mas explicativa inicial do que se leub) Se revisa a primeira nota e se reescreve, agora com mais clareza, como se fosse para entrar em um texto final depois (será?)c) Encaixa essa nota no "conhecimento" anterior, ou seja, as outras notas na caixa. E não pense que isso será fácil. Já vislumbro a dificuldade. Mas vamos começar! 20201027

what really matters are the many small, implicit choices we have to make every day, and they are most often made unconsciously.
LOCATION: 1605

When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed (Arnold and McDermott 2013).
NOTE: Se sou perguntado de algo que não sei, aquilo pode despertar mais interesse em mim sobre o assunto do que simplesmente receber informações sobre aquilo."Qual a distância da lua para terra e qual a importância disso para a agricultura?" Talvez seja muito melhor do que começar a explicar as marés, seus efeitos sobre as plantações, etc...Boas perguntas são mais importantes do que respostas certas

“If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act”
LOCATION: 1641

Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time.
LOCATION: 1661

Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making sure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.
NOTE: A capacidade de se "esquecer" é tão importante - ou mesmo, maior - do que lembrar. Imagine ser tomado por memórias de toda a vida por causa de alguma palavra ou evento? Há até um exempo de um homem que sofreu com a incapacidade de esquecer.Então, estudar realmente é criar pistas no cérebro para podermos recuperar a memória que desejamos, quando desejamos. Porque parece que temos capacidade infinita de armazenamento (x necessidade de esquecer) mas capacidade finita de recuperação
LOCATION: 1867

What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes.
NOTE: slip box funciona  como um enorme conjunto de pistas que conectam
LOCATION: 1887

The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand.
LOCATION: 1911

elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way.
LOCATION: 1913

If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn.
LOCATION: 1930

Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something.
LOCATION: 1939

elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!
NOTE: Diferenças x semelhanças - eis  das chaves para as notas permanebtes serem cassificadas no slpbox
LOCATION: 1950

Notes are only as valuable as the note and reference networks they are embedded in.
LOCATION: 1987

The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.
LOCATION: 2022

Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note.
LOCATION: 2050

A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes.
LOCATION: 2174

If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.
LOCATION: 2184

Being experienced with a problem and intimately familiar with the tools and devices we work with, ideally to the point of virtuosity, is the precondition for discovering their inherent possibilities, writes Ludwik Fleck, a historian of science (Fleck 2012, 126).
LOCATION: 2220

It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.
LOCATION: 2239

To have concrete notes in front of our eyes and be able to compare them directly makes differences, even small ones, much easier to spot.
LOCATION: 2241

Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality (Loewenstein, 2010).
LOCATION: 2262

The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103).
LOCATION: 2270

If we think we can “hold back” an interpretation, we are fooling ourselves.
LOCATION: 2307

We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes.
LOCATION: 2362

By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later. Luhmann choose notes in the format A6. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.
LOCATION: 2371

“Remember the lesson: ‘An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.’” (Charles T. Munger)
LOCATION: 2430

Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not. Every time we make a permanent note, we also made a decision about the aspects of a text we regarded as relevant for our longer-term thinking and relevant for the development of our ideas.
LOCATION: 2457

The process is self-reinforcing. A visibly developed cluster attracts more ideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence our choices on what to read and think further. They become signposts for our daily work and orient us to what is worth thinking about.
LOCATION: 2461

The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones.
