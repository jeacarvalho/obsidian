True worship

When worship does God’s story, our contemplation is simply a delight in the story that worship does. The delight of worship is not expressed in words like “That was a great program,” or “I loved the music today,” or “What an entertaining sermon,” or “I really felt like I was worshiping today,” or “That sure was fun dancing around, shouting ‘Amen!’ and giving my neighbor a high five.” These are descriptions of delight in self as if “I did it; I broke through; I really worshiped.” Worship that generates that kind of response is not worship that glorifies God and his story. Rather, that kind of worship glorifies the self as if the self has generated worship. ***True worship generates the sense of “What a great story,” or “I can’t believe that God would do that for the world and for me,” or “What a God to become human and to restore all things through Christ.”*** For some people the truth declared in worship will be received with exuberance, and for others the truth of God’s story will be received with reserve, with a quiet sense of joy, or even with relief. But for us all, a worship that sings, proclaims, and enacts God’s story should result in a delight that produces an ongoing participation in the purposes of God in life.
