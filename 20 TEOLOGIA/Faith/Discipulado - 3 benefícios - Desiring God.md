Three Benefits of Discipleship | Desiring God

# Three Benefits of Discipleship** **

What happens when you get a group of women in a room to discuss life and the gospel**?**

Talking**.** Lots of talking. And questions. More questions than you can imagine. Why**?** Because we need each other, and sometimes life can be confusing and include insurmountable circumstances**.** During my time in settings like this, I’m reminded of the importance of discipleship**.**

Discipleship can take on many forms. It can be as simple as inviting someone into your kitchen for fellowship to organizing a normally scheduled lunch**.** However it looks, it involves honesty, seeking advice, and Scripture, and someone willing to do all of the above**.**

The Preacher in Ecclesiastes writes, “Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil**.** For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow**.** But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up**!**” ([[Eclesiastes 4]]:9–10)**.**

He is writing about the vanity of trying to work alone as a means to outdo another**.** But labors aren’t the only benefit of working together**.** Two are also better than one as we live out our faith in Christ**.** We really need each other, though we often try to go at it alone**.** We really need reproof and instruction, though we seldom seek it out**.** This is why discipleship is so important**.**

Here are three simple benefits of discipling relationships:

## 1**.** Discipleship builds humility**.**

Our temptation might be to think we know what is best for ourselves**.** As you’ve heard, and maybe said before, “we know ourselves better than anyone**.**” Scripture says that we might actually be more confused than we think**.** The heart is deceitful and so to trust yourself at *all* times is probably not the best route to take ([[Jeremias 17]]:9)**.** Wise counsel from a friend, pastor, or spouse could be just the thing God uses for our protection**.**

Proverbs says that a wise man will hear and learn, and will acquire wise counsel ([[Provérbios 1]]:5)**.** So we can safely assume that an unwise man will not hear from others, will shut them down and will not listen, will lack understanding and will not acquire wise counsel**.** We need to resist the temptation to be wise in our own eyes (Proverbs 3:7)**.** This isn’t so easy! But as we seek to gain understanding, we must first acknowledge that we don’t always know what is best**.**

## 2. Discipleship unites us with fellow believers**.**

The body of Christ isn’t meant to simply exist for us to gather together on Sundays and then move along with our lives the rest of the week**.** God’s word paints a picture of believers doing life together ([[Atos 2]]:44–47)**.** Seeking counsel and discipleship is one way to invite others into your life**.**

Most of the time people won’t know the details of your life unless you are willing to share with them**.** Being willing to be discipled by another provides an opportunity for prayer and mutual encouragement ([[Gálatas 6]]:2; [[I Tessalonicenses 5]]:11)**.** We want to pursue one another because we are members of his body ([[Efésios 5]]:30)**.**

## 3. Discipleship equips us for faithfulness**.**

Paul tells us in [[Tito 2]]:3 that the older women in the church should teach what is good and train the younger women**.** They are to equip other women in how to walk in step with the truth of the gospel**.** And this isn’t a suggestion — it is God’s instruction for how we should relate to one another**.**

This is Discipleship 101. It’s yet another proof that we need each other. We can’t obey the commands in Titus 2 without being willing to be discipled (and being available and willing to disciple others**!**).
