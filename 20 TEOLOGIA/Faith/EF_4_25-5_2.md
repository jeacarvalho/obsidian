Ef 4:25-5:2

The concern in this section, as in much of the New Testament ethical teaching, is to reject what destroys community and promote what builds community.

He uses second person plural verbs throughout, except for 4:28 (third singular) and 5:2 (first person plural). He quotes or alludes to several Old Testament texts in this section: Zechariah 8:16 in 4:25; Psalm 4:4 in 4:26; Isaiah 63:10 in 4:30; possibly Psalm 40:6 in 5:2. Note also the parallels in Colossians 3:8 - 14. Once again the theology of this section is Trinitarian.

This verse may be the most striking description of conversion in the New Testament: “The thief is to become a philanthropist.” The person who did wrong in order to meet his own selfish desires must now work in order to contribute to someone else’s need. This is a compelling example of dying and rising with Christ

As John Calvin noted, all correct knowledge of God originates in obedience

Some Christians worry about such specific directions for living, for they fear it may lead to legalism, but this thinking is far from the New Testament. Texts like this do not endorse legalism; they are descriptions of life in Christ, which is never without content. Christian living requires certain and specific actions. The Christian faith is not a passive religion; it is an aggressive pursuit of the productive and beneficial

As Christians we are part of other believers, and we suffer or thrive with them. Until we take this interrelation seriously, we can never be what we are called to be

Copying God only means taking seriously who God says we are.

The reason the New Testament deletes anger as an option is that anger is largely a self-centered emotion. Anger is a means of communicating what we care about — usually ourselves — and is an attempt at punishment

Our goal is not enjoyment; it is productivity so that we can give. We do not exist for ourselves, but for relations with other people and with God.

Needs are those necessities — material (v. 28) or immaterial (v. 29) — that enable life before God, whereas desires (v. 22) are needs distorted by self-centeredness, pulling us away from God.

The weak cannot forgive; only the strong have the resources to forgive, to give up self-defense. The Christian ethic requires strength and wisdom to know how strength is applied.

What motivates our obedience is not knowledge of correct action but awareness of God

awareness of oneness with other people will not permit inattention or mistreatment of them. If other people are diminished, we are diminished; if they prosper, we prosper with them.

Some theft is direct stealing of property, and in our society much of it is shoplifting or theft by employees

Participation in the body of Christ does not allow some to avoid work or to take advantage

We do not control the actions of others, but in choosing to forgive we establish control over our own responses. We choose to value the other person despite his or her offense and to desire what is good for that person before God
