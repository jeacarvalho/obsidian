Ef 6:10-12

Efésios 6:10-12
A armadura de Deus

- 10 Quanto ao mais,
    - sede fortalecidos no Senhor e na força do seu poder.
- 11 Revesti-vos de toda a armadura de Deus,
    - para poderdes ficar firmes contra as ciladas ( methodeia de um composto de 3326  e 3593  [cf "método"]; TDNT - 5:102,666; n f 1) artifícios, truque, arte, malandragem) do diabo;
        - 12 porque a nossa luta não é contra o sangue e a carne,
        - e sim
            - contra os principados e potestades,
            - contra os dominadores deste mundo tenebroso,
            - contra as forças espirituais do mal, nas regiões celestes.

Readers need to be prepared, as if for battle, for right living does not just happen and opposition is certain.

Wisdom of Solomon 5:17 - 23 may also have been part of the formative background, for it describes the armor of wrath God puts on and adopts “breastplate of righteousness” from Isaiah 59:17. The word for “armor” there is the same word as in Ephesians 6:11, 13 panoplia. See also Ignatius, Letter to Polycarp 6:2, which uses language of battle equipment in an exhortation toward Christian living. In the New Testament, see Romans 13:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:8. Whereas Ephesians has “the breastplate of righteousness” and “the helmet of salvation,” 1 Thessalonians 5:8 has “putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet” (see also Rom. 6:13; 2 Cor. 6:7; 10:3 - 4).

No dependence on Qumran is suggested, but just as the priests wanted to motivate warriors for a literal battle, Paul wants to motivate Christians for the battle with evil.

The passive form of the verb (“be strong”) indicates that this empowering is something done to Christians, not something they do themselves; its present tense shows the empowering is continual. This is not instruction for a quick fix, but for a life spent drawing strength from Christ. To be strong in the Lord means to know his strength and to draw closer to him. It is an exhortation to act on what is known. Similar exhortations appear in 1 Corinthians 16:13; 2 Timothy 2:1 (see also Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:11; 1 Tim. 1:12).

The language describing the armor in verses 14 - 17 is drawn from Isaiah 11:5; 52:7; 59:17

An English translation cannot easily show it, but the imperatives throughout this section are plural. We usually interpret them as if they were addressed to individuals, but without denying their relevance for individuals, we should understand them as Paul’s instructions for the church collectively to put on God’s armor and stand as one person (cf. Phil. 1:27).

Mention of the “schemes” of the devil reminds us of the trickery and subterfuge by which evil and temptation present themselves in our lives. Evil rarely looks evil until it accomplishes its goal; it gains entrance by appearing attractive, desirable, and perfectly legitimate. It is a baited and camouflaged trap. As Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 11:14, Satan masquerades as an angel of light

Luta: This is the only place in the New Testament where the Christian life is described in this sort of language
