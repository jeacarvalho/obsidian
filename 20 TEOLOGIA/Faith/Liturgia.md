Obviously Scripture does not provide a detailed liturgy for our corporate worship, but it does indicate various elements that should be included:

- We should corporately*** confess the attributes of God,*** such [[Apocalipse 4]]Rev. 4:10–11).
- Our songs should proclaim the ***worthiness of Christ as the Redeemer-King who has purchased people*** from every tribe and language and people to be a kingdom of priests ([[Apocalipse 5]]:9–10).
- The*** preaching of God’s redemptive plan as revealed in Scripture should be the focal point*** of our corporate gathering as the eschatological people of God (see Rev. 5:1–14).
- Our corporate worship should be marked by ***fervent prayer so that God’s heavenly throne room is filled with the sweet aroma of incense*** (Rev. 5:8; 8:3–5).

Thus Scripture itself, whether through an explicit command or a necessary implication of a biblical text, should govern our corporate worship.22 God abundantly demonstrates that he cares how his people worship him in both the old and new covenants (Exod. 20:4; 32:1–10; Lev. 10:1–20; John 4:19–24; 1 Cor. 11:2–34; 14:1–40; 1 Tim. 2:8–15; 4:13–16). We would be wise, then, to allow God’s revelation in Scripture to determine the content, intent, and tenor of our worship.
