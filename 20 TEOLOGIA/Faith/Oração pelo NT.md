- All Christians were expected to have a fervent prayer life ([[Romanos 12]]:2; [[Romanos 15]]:30; [[Colossenses 4]]:2), praying in all sorts of ways for all kinds of things ([[Efésios 6]]:18). 
- It was expected that spouses might even part from each other for times of sustained prayer ([[I Coríntios 7]]7:5).

- Every gift you receive should be “consecrated” through prayer—you should thank God for it lest your heart become hard through an illusion of self-sufficiency (1 Tim 4:5).
