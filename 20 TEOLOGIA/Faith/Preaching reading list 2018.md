### The 2018 Effective Preacher’s Reading List

**_Resonate: Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences_** by Nancy Duarte

Nancy Duarte is a communication expert who has analyzed countless sermons and speeches in search of the Holy Grail for creating effective presentations. She has found it and in this fascinating and enlightening book, she reveals it. If you want the secret ingredient to preaching captivating sermons read this book.

**_Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die_** by Chip and Dan Heath

This book should be required reading for every preaching and public speaking class. It is not specifically about verbal communication but it applies to anyone who wants their message to be remembered. There is a reason why you remember some messages and forget others. If you want your sermon to live beyond Sunday heed the advice of the Heath brothers.

**_Surviving the Stained Glass Jungle_** by Bill Self

A pastor of large churches for over 50 years, Bill Self was a spectacular preacher and ministry sage. He passed away a couple of years ago but his indispensable wisdom lives on in this invaluable book. His chapter on preaching alone is worth 100 times the cost of the book. Read it and go from good to great as a preacher and pastor.

**_Communicating for a Change_** by Andy Stanley

It is foolish not to learn from one of the best Christian communicators in the country. Regardless of how you may feel about Stanley’s theology or approach, there is a reason why he leads one of the largest churches in America and pastors flock to Atlanta to learn from him. If you want to learn how to preach to millennials buy this book.

**_TED Talks: The Official TED GUIDE to Public Speaking_** by Chris Anderson

The popularity of Ted Talks is good news for preachers. Public speaking as a medium is very much alive and well. Of course, not all sermons are as engaging as many Ted Talks, which is why every preacher should read this book. Chris Anderson is the “head cheese” of Ted Talks and in this book, he lays out why so many Ted Talks are compelling and shows you how to apply the principles to your sermons and presentations. Have this one nearby when you prepare sermons.

**_The Witness of Preaching_** by Tom Long

This is the only preaching textbook on the list. I don’t have a problem with textbooks, but they are not always accessible and practical. What I like about Long’s book is that it combines homiletic theory with practice. His chapter on biblical exegesis for preaching is the best one I’ve read on the subject. Stay sharp as a biblical preacher by reading this book.

**_Determining the Form_** by O. Wesley Allen

The importance of sermon design cannot be overstated. It is not just what a sermon is about; it’s _how_ it’s about it.  Allen has a strong grasp on different sermon forms and styles and he shows you how to use them effectively in your own preaching. Read this book and you will be able to structure your sermons with power.

**_Moving Mountains: The Art of Letting Others See Things Your Way_** by Henry Boettinger

This book is out of print but its principles are timeless. So snag a used copy off the internet. If you only buy the book for chapter 3 on “How to Get and Hold Attention” it is well worth whatever price you pay. 40 years ago Boettinger discovered the same Holy Grail for irresistible presentations as Nancy Duarte. In the book (chapter 3) he dissects the “grail” and gives you a deeper understanding of the technique.

**_Public Speaking as Listeners Like It!_** by Richard Borden

This is by far the oldest book on the list. It has been out of print for years but do yourself a favor and find a used copy on Amazon. I know public speaking instructors who would not sell their copy for a hundred dollars. In the book, long-time public speaking guru Richard Borden lays out his simple “Borden Formula” for giving speeches. But don’t let the simplicity of his approach fool you. Try preaching your next sermon using his method and watch what happens. You will be amazed.

**_The Sir Winston Method_** by James Humes

What preacher could not benefit from learning about what made Churchill a great communicator? Hume is a longtime expert on public speaking and in this intriguing book he unpacks Churchill’s formula for success as a speaker. This book contains priceless gems that will improve your skills as a communicator.
