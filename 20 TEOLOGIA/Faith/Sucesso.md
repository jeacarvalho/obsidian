 **Question: "How does the Bible define success?"

Answer: ** When King David was about to die, he gave his son, Solomon, the following advice: “Do what the LORD your God commands and follow his teachings. Obey everything written in the Law of Moses. Then you will be a success, no matter what you do or where you go” ( [1 Kings 2:3 CEV](http://biblia.com/bible/cev/1%20Kings%202.3)). Notice that David didn’t tell his son to build up his kingdom with great armies, or to gather wealth from other lands, or to defeat his enemies in battle. Instead, his formula for success was to follow God and obey Him. When Solomon became king, he didn’t ask the Lord for wealth and power, but for wisdom and discernment in order to lead God’s people. God was pleased by this request and granted it, giving Solomon a wise and understanding heart, more than any man had ever had before. He also gave Solomon the things he didn’t ask for—riches and honor among men ( [1 Kings 3:1-14](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Kings%203.1-14)). Solomon took his father’s advice to heart, at least for most of his reign, and reflected on it in his writing in Proverbs: “My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man” ( [Proverbs 3:1-4 (ESV)](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%203.1-4).

[[Jesus]] reiterated this teaching in the New Testament when He declared which is the greatest commandment: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these" ( [Mark 12:30-31](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%2012.30-31)). Loving God means obeying Him and keeping His commandments ( [John 14:15](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2014.15), [23-24](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2014.23-24)). The first step in this process is accepting the free gift of eternal life offered by Jesus Christ ( [John 3:16](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.16)). This is the beginning of true biblical success. When the gift is received, transformation begins. The process is accomplished, not by human will, but by God’s Holy Spirit ( [John 1:12-13](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%201.12-13)). How does this happen and what is the result? It happens first through trusting the Lord and obeying Him. As we obey Him, He transforms us, giving us a completely new nature ( [1 Corinthians 5:17](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor%205.17)). As we go through trouble and hard times, which the Bible calls “trials,” we are able to endure with great peace and direction, and we begin to understand that God uses those very trials to strengthen our inner person ( [John 16:33](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2016.33); [James 1:2](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/James%201.2)). In other words, trouble in life does not cause us to fail, but to walk through trouble with God’s grace and wisdom. By obeying God, we gain freedom from the curses of this world—hate, jealousy, addictions, confusion, inferiority complexes, sadness without reason, anger, bitterness, unforgiveness, selfishness and more.

In addition, followers of Christ (Christians) possess and display the fruit of the Spirit of God who resides in their hearts—love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control ( [Galatians 5:22-23](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%205.22-23)). We have at our disposal knowledge to know what to do and where to turn ( [Proverbs 3:5-6](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%203.5-6)), unhindered amounts of wisdom ( [James 1:5](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/James%201.5)), and the peace that passes understanding ( [Philippians 4:7](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%204.7)). As we grow and mature in Christ, we begin to think not only of ourselves but of others. Our greatest joy becomes what we can do for others and give to others, and how we can help them grow and prosper spiritually. Those who have risen to these heights of achievement understand true success, because a person can have all the power, money, popularity and prestige the world has to offer, but if his soul is empty and bitter, worldly success is really failure. “What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?” ( [Matthew 16:26](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2016.26)).

One last word on biblical success. While transformation of our inner lives is God’s goal for us, He also abundantly provides good physical gifts to His children (food, clothing, houses, etc.), and He loves to do it ( [Matthew 6:25-33](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.25-33)). Yet, most of us, at one time or another, focus on the gifts rather than on the Giver. That’s when we regress in our contentment and joy and we quench the Spirit’s transforming work within us, because we are focusing on the wrong things. That may be why the Lord sometimes limits His gift-giving to us—so we do not stumble over the gifts and fall away from Him.

Picture two hands. In the right hand there are the offer of true contentment, the ability to handle life’s problems without being overcome by them, amazing peace that sees us through all circumstances, wisdom to know what to do, knowledge and constant direction for life, love for others, acceptance of ourselves, joy no matter what, and at the end of life, an eternity with the God who freely gives all these gifts. The other hand holds all the money and power and success the world has to offer, without any of what the right hand holds. Which would you choose? The Bible says, “Where your treasure is, there also is your heart” ( [Matthew 6:21](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.21)). That which is in the right hand is the biblical definition of success.
