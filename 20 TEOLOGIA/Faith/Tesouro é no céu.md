Tesouro é no céu.

Possessing such an anticipation for heaven builds in us what I call an eternal vantage point. I live in a world that continually offers me temporal securities and comforts, a world that keeps my eye on the near horizon of the  present, that denies the limitations of my own mortality. My “life of work” aims not simply to make a contribution to my career, but to provide a means of security in the world: a home, a stable income, an investment scheme, a retirement program. While [[Jesus]] is clear that these securities are foolish and unreliable ( Matt.fers a positive incentive. Our true home, our complete security has already been built for us by him in heaven. Once we embrace the significance of this notion, our attitudes toward this world completely change.
