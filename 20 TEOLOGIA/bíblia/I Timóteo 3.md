Não há dúvida de que é grande o mistério da piedade: Deus foi manifestado em corpo , justificado no Espírito, visto pelos anjos, pregado entre as nações, crido no mundo, recebido na glória. 1 Timóteo 3:16 NVI
- Deus foi justificado?

- 1 Timóteo 3:16 (New American Commentary - New Testament Set)
- Lenski takes "spirit" to be a reference to the vindication of Christ's spirit of holy obedience even to the death of the cross. Since the first line of this hymn refers to being manifest in the realm of the flesh, it seems that the parallel in line 2 is suggesting that Christ was vindicated or declared righteous in the sphere of his spiritual nature.
- 1 Timóteo 3:16 (New American Commentary - New Testament Set)
- What Paul was saying is that just as Christ was manifested in human flesh, so he was proved to be what he claimed to be in the spiritual realm. The resurrection of Christ declared that he was God's Son.
- 1 Timóteo 3:14 (REC)
- God the Son did not remain in the grave, however; he was “vindicated by the Spirit” (1 Tim. 3:16). In other words, the Holy Spirit confirmed and proved that Jesus Christ is God’s own Son and the Savior of the world by raising him from the dead.
- 1 Timóteo 3:14 (REC)
- When was Jesus vindicated? The Holy Spirit proved Jesus was who he claimed to be throughout his earthly ministry. The Spirit proved it at Jesus’ baptism, when he descended upon him from heaven like a dove (Matt. 3:16). He proved it by preserving Jesus from sin throughout his earthly ministry. He proved it whenever he performed miracles, especially when he drove out demons. “But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons,” Jesus said, “then the kingdom of God has come upon you” ([[Mateus 12]]:28). The Spirit vindicated the Son in all these ways, but most of all he did it through the resurrection
- 1 Timóteo 3:14 (REC)
- Justification is a legal declaration. In this case, it means that by his resurrection Jesus was declared to be the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
- e que mediante o Espírito de santidade foi declarado Filho de Deus com poder, pela sua ressurreição dentre os mortos: Jesus Cristo, nosso Senhor. [[Romanos 1]]:4 NVI
