Tipping Points in the 5 Discoveries of Sustained Desired Change

1. Qual é o ideal desejado?
2. Qual é realidade hoje?
3. Agenda de aprendizado para ir do real ao desejado
4. Realizar os passos, não somente planejar. Se no fim do dia continuo a fazer as mesmas coisas não há evolução
5. Ter uma rede de "prestação de contas"

- The** first of these discoveries** involves getting in touch with what we call the** ideal self**; Who you really want to be, and what you really want to do.
- The** second discovery** of the model involves getting in touch with what we call the** real self**. who am I today? But it's not who am I today in an absolute sense. It's, who am I today relative to who I've said I want to be?
- The** third discovery**, then, involves a creation of what we call a **learning agenda**. Which is essentially a **plan**, for doing   what it is you're excited to do to move your real self to where it's more closely aligned with your ideal. A key onsideration here, is that this learning agenda or plan, should start with the acknowledgment and then the leveraging and building of strengths you have
- **fourth discovery** of the model recognizes that no matter how elaborate a plan you put together in that third discovery, at  the end of the day if you continue to do what you've always done, you'll continue to be who've you always been, period.** You want to practice to the point of mastery**, to where you don't even have to think about it anymore. "*amateurs practice until they get it right, professionals practice until they can't get it wrong*"
- the **fifth discovery** recognizes that you're gonna be more successful in your change efforts if you embed them within a network of trusting, **supportive relationships with others**
