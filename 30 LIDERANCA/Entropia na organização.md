Entropia na organização

I am using the word “entropy” in a loose way, because technically it has to do with the second law of thermodynamics. From a corporate management point of view, I choose to define it as meaning that everything has a tendency to deteriorate.

One of the important things leaders need to learn is to recognize the signals of impending deterioration. I have made a list of these signals over the years.

 As you read this list, remember that many people in large organizations relish apathy. They often fail to see the signs of entropy:

- a tendency toward superficiality
- a dark tension among key people
- no longer having time for celebration and ritual
- a growing feeling that rewards and goals are the same thing
- when people stop telling tribal stories or cannot understand them
- a recurring effort by some to convince others that business is, after all, quite simple (The acceptance of complexity and ambiguity and the ability to deal with them constructively are essential.)
- when people begin to have different understandings of words like “responsibility” or “service” or “trust”
- when problem-makers outnumber problem-solvers
- when folks confuse heroes and celebrities
- leaders who seek to control rather than liberate
- when the pressures of day-to-day operations push aside our concern for vision and risk (I think you know that vision and risk can never be separated.)
- an orientation toward the dry rules of business school rather than a value orientation that takes into account such things as contribution, spirit, excellence, beauty, and joy
- when people speak of customers as impositions on their time rather than as opportunities to serve
- manuals
- a growing urge to quantify both history and one’s thoughts about the future (You may be familiar with people who take a look at a prototype and say, “In 1990 we’ll sell $6,493,000 worth”—nothing is more devastating because then you plan either to make that happen or to avoid it.)
- the urge to establish ratios
- leaders who rely on structures instead of people
- a loss of confidence in judgment, experience, and wisdom
- a loss of grace and style and civility
- a loss of respect for the English language
