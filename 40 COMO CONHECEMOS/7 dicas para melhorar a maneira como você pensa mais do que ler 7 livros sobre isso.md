7 prompts to improve the way you think more than reading 7 books about it: [![Image](https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTmpQnbUEAAg5XD.png)

# "It reminds me..."

Saying "it reminds me..." forces your brain to rev up and make connections. Connections lead to insights. And we need your unique insights because only you can make them!

If you make it a habit to say this, you will never think the same way again.

# "It's a part of…"

This prompt forces you to relate the thing you are talking about to something else you already know.

Guess what? That's how we learn!

We connect new stuff to old stuff.

Try it now: "Thinking is a part of… "

# "It's similar to BLANK because…"

This prompt gets you pattern matching. You start to see the patterns that are hidden from everyone else

You see how math rhymes with music and how jazz rhymes with improv

When you see the patterns, the world gets a lot easier to understand

# "It's different to BLANK because..."

If everything is the same, then what's the point? The differences are what make things interesting.

This prompt sharpens your mind because it forces you to say why two things are different.

# "It's important because..."

The prompt forces you to argue why this thing is important. You will understand more deeply why you care about it.

Or you will realize that maybe you should stop paying attention to it!

# "It came from..."

This prompt makes you understand the relationships. Everything came from something.

Take an idea you are interested in. Where did it come from?

This places it in context. We understand things more deeply when we understand where they came from.

# "It's really about..."

I love this prompt because it forces you to stop getting fed other people's talking points.

Instead, when you say this out loud, you have to go deep to answer.

You might be surprised what you say!

Those 7 prompts are worth their weight in gold. But will you practice with them of just keep distracting yourself by saving another article you'll never read?

Instead of mindlessly highlighting "yet another article", there is a better way to work with ideas.

It's nerdy, but you can learn the core concept of how to think better with digital notes. It's call "Idea Emergence" 👇
