#### Nossa coragem precisa nos ajudar a fazer perguntas difíceis, mesmo que as respostas possam abalar nossa vida
Reflect on the tremendous courage needed to impartially consider arguments that threaten your most fundamental beliefs. What if you decide they are correct? For me that might include questions like, What if there is no Creator God who loves me personally and gives life its only real meaning? What if all of this is, as Freud and others have claimed, simply wish fulfillment? The whole world, as I have understood it, would come crashing down. The very foundation of my life would be betrayed as a sham. Talk about a frightening possibility. But if I want to be a genuinely fair-minded person, there are times when I am required to give a hearing to deeply threatening ideas—and that requires tremendous courage. In this way, intellectual courage can play a critical role in the exercise of all the intellectual virtues.
