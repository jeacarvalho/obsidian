## The ingredients of metacognition

Metacognition has many components, but it doesn’t mean that it has to be complicated to apply. According to [scientists](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1003044231033), there are only three skills you need to master in order to improve your metacognition.

1.  **Planning.** Before you start learning something, tackling a new problem, or exploring a creative idea, think about the appropriate strategies you will use, as well as how you will allocate your time and energy. This phase is based on your metacognitive knowledge — of yourself (declarative knowledge), learning strategies (procedural knowledge), and when to use them to maximise your performance (conditional knowledge).
2.  **Monitoring.** While learning, solving a problem, or working on a creative project, stay aware of your progress. Are you struggling with certain aspects in particular? Are there other elements that seem to be a breeze to go through? Instead of passively experiencing your thoughts and feelings, ask yourself these questions to see what works and what doesn’t.
3.  **Evaluating.** When you’re done with a chunk of work, consider how well you performed and re-evaluate the strategies you used. Make any necessary changes before starting to work on the next part of your project.
