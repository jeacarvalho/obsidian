# My Novel Writing Process | Jurgen Appelo no Patreon

I am sharing with you my writing process. This 10-stage process is a mix of expert advice and personal experience. Of course, your mileage will vary. All writers are different in their approaches. But maybe this will inspire some of you. And I'm curious to learn what you do differently and why.

The percentages are a rough indication allowing for a calculation of how far I am in the project. I am at one-fifth of the story in Stage 4 (2nd draft) with my current novel. That means I finished 30% of the project (the first three stages) plus another 5% (a fifth of the fourth stage). In other words, **I'm about 35% done with my novel**.

### Stage 1: Planning - 1st outline (2%)

-   Use a story template to create an outline with structure and plot points. Define the main characters, central conflict, main locations, and essential worldbuilding aspects. The goal is to have a story that's worth telling.

### Stage 2: Planning - 2nd outline (3%)

-   Fill in all the holes in the story template. Write the synopsis and make notes of all individual scenes. The goal here is to have a story that you could tell someone over a campfire or several cups of coffee. Try to get early feedback on the story before you start writing.

### Stage 3: Drafting - 1st draft (25%)

-   Do freewriting in an unconstrained manner. Write out the entire story, and the uglier, the better because you don't want to feel too attached to any of it. Deviate from the outline and discover what is worth exploring. In the end, you need to know precisely what the story is really all about.

### Stage 4: Drafting - 2nd draft (25%)

-   Now that you know the real story start again at the beginning and write it better. Aim for consistency. Play with different points of view and a different tone of voice per character. Ensure there's rhythm and flow and no loose ends in the plot. This is the first version that other people can read. Send it off to a development editor for feedback.

### Stage 5: Revising - 1st revision (15%)

-   Process feedback from the development editor. Fix all problems with scenes, characters, and locations. Instead of doing this start-to-finish, you might want to do the revisions per character and per location so that you can check them each for style, dialect, mood, etc.

### Stage 6: Revising - 2nd revision (15%)

-   After the first revision, the entire story is now pretty solid. Only now can you start writing beautifully. Find better words. Discover better analogies. Tweak sentences to make them more poetic. Don't do this earlier because you will hate changing or deleting bad scenes that you wrote so beautifully.

### Stage 7: Editing - 1st edit (5%)

-   Check for improvements in punctuation, and flow. Read the story as a reader would. Read it to yourself out loud, so it's easier to find where the text doesn't flow. Use a spell checker and grammar checker to weed out all basic mistakes before you send it off to a copy editor. Don't waste their time with mistakes that software can find for you.

### Stage 8: Editing - 2nd edit (5%)

-   Process feedback from the copy editor. Decide which suggestions you agree with and which ones you will ignore. Send the wholly edited and fixed version to beta readers for final feedback. You want them to give you feedback on the story, not on writing mistakes.

### Stage 9: Publishing - manuscript (5%)

-   The project is almost done! Include a cover, front matter, back matter, and possibly visuals. Export your work as a manuscript that's ready to send to agents. If you're self-publishing, export it to digital formats for printers and online platforms.

### Stage 10: Promoting

-   Woohoo! The book is available. Now, promote the hell out of it on social media and everywhere else you can.

As I said, this is how the writing process works for me.

I've noticed that most writing processes of other authors are a lot less disciplined than mine. But maybe that's the reason why many are struggling while I can keep a comfortable, steady pace. I always know what to do next.
