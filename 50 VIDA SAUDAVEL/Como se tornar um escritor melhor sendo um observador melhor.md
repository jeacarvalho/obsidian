# How to Become a Better Writer by Becoming a Better Noticer – The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss

## Exercises

1\. **The German Word Exercise**  
It’s often said that the Germans have a word for everything. The most famous example is [_Schadenfreude_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude) —pleasure one derives from another’s misfortune. But there are countless others: [_Politikverdrossenheit_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politikverdrossenheit)_—_a disenchantment with politics—is a word that English could really use. Then there’s [_Kummerspeck_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kummerspeck)—the excess fat gained from emotional overeating. It literally translates to “grief bacon.”

But, of course, there are countless subtle experiences and emotions that have not yet been named in any language. This exercise asks you to identify an experience or emotional state that hasn’t yet been named and to write a short passage about it. (Make the word up too!)

2\. **The “Seeking the Extraordinary in the Ordinary” Exercise**  
Find an everyday object in your home and describe it in exquisite detail while also reflecting on what the object means to you or makes you think about. 

3\. **The Alien Exercise**  
Imagine that you’re an alien arriving on planet Earth for the first time. You have to write a report on “the humans.” The idea is to help you look at daily life through fresh eyes. When done properly, almost everything we do can seem newly strange.

4\. **The Noticing Chain**  
Maybe the most important of all, this exercise involves noticing something—it can be anything—and writing it down in a few sentences. The aim is then to do a second noticing that builds upon the first—and to continue for at least ten steps, pushing the thinking further and further. Students are often amazed by where their thoughts end up by the fifth step.

5. **Reading Like a Writer**  
If you want to improve your noticing—or any other aspect of your writing—you also have to read a lot and pay close attention to how professional writers do it. And if you need a place to start, you could (ahem) purchase a new book called [_Ravenous_](https://www.amazon.com/Ravenous-Warburg-Search-Cancer-Diet-Connection/dp/1631493159/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20).
