#### Condições para entrar em [[Estado de Fluxo]]

1.  The activity involves the use of the body. Even though it is possible to achieve flow during activities, such as reading or playing cognitive games, that are physically engaging tend to lead to deeper states of flow.
    
2.  The task at hand has **clear goals**. This clarity provides direction and structure, and it is essential that there is a realistic chance to complete the task: if achieving the goal is not possible, interest in the task tends to dissipate.
    
3.  The environment provides **immediate feedback on progress** towards achieving the desired goals. This aspect helps the person negotiate any changes in demands and allows adjusting performance, thereby maintaining high levels of attention and interest in the task.
    
4.  A good balance between the perceived challenges of the task and one’s perceived skills. If the task is too easy then there is a loss of concentration, as concentration is not needed to complete the task; if the task is too difficult then there is a loss of confidence and an increase in anxiety, as task completion is seen as impossible.
    
5.  One must act with a deep but effortless involvement. The person has a sense of control over one’s actions, a sense that one can deal with the situation.
