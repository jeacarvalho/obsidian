#### Resultados do [[estado de fluxo]]
Several experiences are seen as manifestations (or ‘outcomes’) of the state of flow (Csikszentmihalyi, Latter, and Weinkauff Duranso [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23800127.2021.1912947#)):

1.  Intense and focused concentration on the present moment: ‘Flow \[…\] makes the present instance more enjoyable, \[…\] because it builds the self-confidence that allows us to develop skills and make significant contributions to humankind’ (Csikszentmihalyi [Citation1990](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23800127.2021.1912947#), 42).
    
2.  The merging of action and awareness: Flow involves full immersion in the task in question without thinking of experiences in other places or time.
    
3.  A loss of reflective self-consciousness and lack of absent-mindedness: Flow is neither daydreaming nor the brain’s ‘default network’, activated by internal self-reflecting cognitive tasks like autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future or conceiving the perspectives of others (Buckner, Andrews‐Hanna, and Schacter [Citation2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23800127.2021.1912947#)).
    
4.  A temporary disregard for the sense of the self: Even though during flow individuals temporarily lose some awareness about their own existence (due to total focus on the task at hand), paradoxically the sense of the self as an integrated and harmonious entity emerges stronger after the flow experience is over.

5.  The activity is experienced as intrinsically rewarding (autotelic experience): In other words, individuals enjoy the activity for its own sake and not because they expect to derive social, economic, or health benefits from it.
