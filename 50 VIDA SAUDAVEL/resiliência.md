Research shows 5 major factors or resilience:
1. **Accepting** reality even if it's hard.
2. **Asking** for help.
3. Being **patient**; knowing what feels like forever in the moment is not.
4. **Narrative** that you'll grow from struggle.
5. **Routine**—helps to activate and provides predictability.
