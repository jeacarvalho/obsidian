### In 2015, Brazil had as many homicides as all the blue countries combined ([interactive version](https://maps.blueshift.io/homicides-by-country))

You’re probably aware that Brazil is a dangerous place with a high murder rate. But what may come as a surprise is just how big the disparity is between Brazil and other large countries. Indeed, Brazil saw nearly 60,000 murders in 2015, as many as the United States, China, all of Europe, Northern Africa, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand combined.

Pretty striking!

For some added perspective, here is the same data shown as a [treemap](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#hierarchies-d3-hierarchy). Each is country sized proportionally to its annual homicide count.
