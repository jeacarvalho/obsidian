Carol e trabalho produtivo

- The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

- Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

- To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.

- If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn’t expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.

- High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

- Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.

- Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

- Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some home truths,” Gallagher reports. “Among them is the notion that the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’… when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.

- The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

- Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

- To build your working life around the experience of [[Estado de Fluxo]] produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. 

- Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports [[maestria]] can also generate a sense of sacredness.

- Escritório é lugar de trabalho produtivio, sagrado. Não de trabalho manual, repetitivo, que suja e bagunça. Assim, devemos manter isso aqui lindo, brilhando, branco, clean!

Atenção, Carol!!!

- “We deny that these differences between expert performers and normal adults are immutable… Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a **life-long period** of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.”

- Esforço deliberado, por um grande período, para aumentar a capacidade de realizar... Eis o segredo. Atenção, Carol! **Começa agora!**
