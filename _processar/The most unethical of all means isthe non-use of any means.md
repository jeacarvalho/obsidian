Rules for Radicals

I present here a series of rules pertaining to the ethics of
means and ends: first, that one’s concern with the ethics of
means and ends varies inversely with one’s personal
interest in the issue. When we are not directly concerned
our morality overflows; as La Rochefoucauld put it, “We all
have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others.”
Accompanying this rule is the parallel one that one’s
concern with the ethics of means and ends varies inversely
with one’s distance from the scene of conflict.
The second rule of the ethics of means and ends is that
the judgment of the ethics of means is dependent upon the
political position of those sitting in judgment. If you actively
opposed the Nazi occupation and joined the underground
Resistance, then you adopted the means of assassination,
terror, property destruction, the bombing of tunnels and
trains, kidnapping, and the willingness to sacrifice innocent
hostages to the end of defeating the Nazis. Those who
opposed the Nazi conquerors regarded the Resistance as a
secret army of selfless, patriotic idealists, courageous
beyond expectation and willing to sacrifice their lives to
their moral convictions. To the occupation authorities,
however, these people were lawless terrorists, murderers,
saboteurs, assassins, who believed that the end justified the
means, and were utterly unethical according to the mystical rules of war


History is made up of “moral” judgments based on
politics. We condemned Lenin’s acceptance of money from
the Germans in 1917 but were discreetly silent while our
Colonel William B. Thompson in the same year contributed a
million dollars to the anti-Bolsheviks in Russia. As allies of
the Soviets in World War II we praised and cheered
communist guerrilla tactics when the Russians used them
against the Nazis during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet
Union; we denounce the same tactics when they are used
by communist forces in different parts of the world against
us. The opposition’s means, used against us, are always
immoral and our means are always ethical and rooted in the
highest of human values.


The third rule of the ethics of means and ends is that in
war the end justifies almost any means. Agreements on the
Geneva rules on treatment of prisoners or use of nuclear
weapons are observed only because the enemy or his
potential allies may retaliate. Winston Churchill’s remarks to his private secretary a few
hours before the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union graphically
pointed out the politics of means and ends in war. Informed
of the imminent turn of events, the secretary inquired how Churchill, the leading British anti-communist, could reconcile
himself to being on the same side as the Soviets. Would not
Churchill find it embarrassing and difficult to ask his
government to support the communists? Churchill’s reply
was clear and unequivocal: “Not at all. I have only one
purpose, the destruction of Hitler, and my life is much
simplified thereby. If Hitler invaded Hell I would make at
least a favorable reference to the Devil in the House of
Commons.”

The fourth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that
judgment must be made in the context of the times in which
the action occurred and not from any other chronological
vantage point.

The fifth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that
concern with ethics increases with the number of means
available and vice versa. To the man of action the first
criterion in determining which means to employ is to assess
what means are available.

The sixth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that the
less important the end to be desired, the more one can
afford to engage in ethical evaluations of means.
The seventh rule of the ethics of means and ends is that
generally success or failure is a mighty determinant of
ethics. The judgment of history leans heavily on the
outcome of success or failure; it spells the difference
between the traitor and the patriotic hero. There can be no
such thing as a successful traitor, for if one succeeds he
becomes a founding father.
The eighth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that the
morality of a means depends upon whether the means is
being employed at a time of imminent defeat or imminent
victory.

In short, ethics are
determined by whether one is losing or winning. From the
beginning of time killing has always been regarded as
justifiable if committed in self-defense


The ninth rule of the ethics of means and ends is that any
effective means is automatically judged by the opposition as
being unethical.
