**Hallstatt, Austria is a fairytale come to life.** I’ve been dreaming of visiting this magical village ever since I first saw a picture of it, and I knew instantly that I wanted to visit in winter. I’m a mountains & snow girl, and there’s nothing more snowy and mountainy than a village on a lake in the Austrian Alps. We needed an excuse to share all of the stunning photos we took during our visit to Hallstatt in the winter, so we’ve compiled our favorites into one photo-heavy post – plus all the details you need to plan your own trip to Hallstatt, of course!

Snowy Hallstatt, Austria in front of a mountain, reflected in the icy lake. Basically a fairytale Christmas village come to life.

## Arriving in Hallstatt, Austria

You know how sometimes you visit a bucket-list destination and it’s not what you imagined? Well, this was like that, in that it was SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN I IMAGINED.

Hallstatt is a LIVING Christmas village, like the kind of fairytale town that Jeremy’s grandmother builds each year, complete with teeny trains and fluffy cotton snow. Except life-sized!

To get to Hallstatt, we took a real-sized train thanks to our [Eurail pass](http://tidd.ly/b0d11072), and hopped off at the Hallstatt stop, directly across the lake from the town. Here we found a tiny dock with a tiny ferry – named Stefanie – to shepherd visitors from the train to the village.

This is hands down the most magical, dramatic way to approach a tiny beautiful fairytale mountain town and we highly recommend it.

Hallstatt is beautiful from literally every angle. It’s like the town version of Beyonce.

As we clamored onto Stefanie the ferry, snow began to fall in earnest, so that we could barely make out the town of Hallstatt through the snowy mist swirling around the mountains.

And then, we saw it: the spire of the church. The reflection of the lights in the water. The pitched roofs of 800-year old houses, dusted with fresh snow. Mother flipping SWANS playing in the water!!

**This was it: my heaven.**

![The Marketplatz in the center of Hallstatt, Austria in the winter.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Main-Square.jpg)
The Marketplatz in the center of Hallstatt is peak charming.

I had never seen any place so beautiful in my life, and I couldn’t stop staring. After the ferry docked, I stayed on until everyone left, taking pictures and openly gawking – until they (very nicely) asked me to please leave.

We shouldered our backpacks and crunched our way up the path into town. Each new view was more exciting than the last.

I was giddy. If I wasn’t saddled with a 30-pound backpack, I probably would have skipped through town.

## **The Town of Hallstatt, Austria**

To get to the inn where we would spend the next two nights, we headed straight into town on the main road – and promptly stopped in our tracks.

We’d found the **Marketplatz**, the main square of Hallstatt, Austria.  It was multi-colored, there was a giant Christmas tree, everything was snow-covered and magical, and I died and went to heaven right then and there.

![The Marketplatz in Hallstatt, Austria first thing in the morning, under a dusting of fresh snow. ](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-Winter-Marketplatz.jpg)
The Marketplatz in Hallstatt, Austria first thing in the morning, under a dusting of fresh snow. What is it about pastels and snow that just go together SO well?!

We had to stop ourselves from ducking into the welcoming shops lining the square, boasting signs like **FRESH LEBKUCHEN** and **PINECONE SCHNAPPS**. _(Don’t worry, we came back later. They were both delicious and yes, they both tasted like Christmas in the mountains)_.

![Pink buildings and a star hanging from a tree in snowy Hallstatt, Austria in the winter.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Snowy-Tree-and-Star-in-Hallstatt-Austria-in-the-Winter.jpg)
The colorful buildings near the Hallstatt Museum just off the main square. We saw these beautiful yellow stars all through the town, but couldn’t figure out why!

After just a few minutes of joyfully crunching through fresh new snow in the most beautiful town I’ve ever seen in my life, we arrived at our hotel: [**the Bräu-Gasthof,**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/booking?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fat%2Fbra-ugasthof-hallstatt.en.html%3Faid%3D1321795%26no_rooms%3D1%26group_adults%3D1) which means brewery guesthouse.

YES Y’ALL, we stayed in a 700-year old brewery!

![The Bräu-Gasthof in Hallstatt, Austria, in the winter.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/Brau-Gasthauf-in-Hallstatt-Austria-in-the-Winter-Outside.jpg)
The Bräu-Gasthof is directly on the main street in Hallstatt and is one of the primary destinations for visitors because of a group of trees decorated with hanging stars just out front! Hey, can you see me up there on our little balcony?

We dropped our bags in our room with a sigh of relief and headed right back out to explore Hallstatt in the snow as the sunset. This is the perfect time of day to wander through Hallstatt, as the crowds from visiting tour groups have all gone home already and only a few like us who opted to stay overnight are left.

Blissfully empty streets in Hallstatt, Austria. The tour groups fill up the main street around midday, but early morning and late afternoon-evening are the perfect times to explore a quieter Hallstatt, Austria!

## Where to Stay in Hallstatt, Austria

As night and snow fell, we made our way back to warm, cozy [**Bräu-Gasthof**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/booking?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fat%2Fbra-ugasthof-hallstatt.xu.html%3Faid%3D1321795%26no_rooms%3D1%26group_adults%3D1) for dinner. The Bräu-Gasthof is home to one of the best restaurants in Hallstatt, and we were eager to try some cozy comfort food!

We stomped off the snow from our boots and rubbed our frozen noses, entered the restaurant, and promptly went back in time about 700 years.

![The food at our accomodation, the 700-year-old Brau-Gasthof (brewery guesthouse), was some of the best we tried in Austria! Pictured here: goulash with dumplings, clear broth soup, and beer (of course).](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Dumplings-at-Braugasthof.jpg)

I imagine our dinner at the Bräu-Gasthof was much like it would have been centuries ago. We warmed up over a bowl of clear, shimmering broth with a single fried cheese dumpling soaking up all of its brothy goodness, which nourished me down to my freakin’ soul.

![Lia in a hat gazing out of the window of the Bräu-Gasthof in Hallstatt, Austria.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Gazing-out-the-window-from-rau-Gasthof-in-Hallstatt-Austria.jpg)

In addition to some of the coziest, most soul-nourishing, delicious meals we ate during our entire trip to Austria, the Bräu-Gasthof was also surprisingly comfortable for a 700-year old inn. 

Although one corner of our room contained a large, ancient wood-burning furnace, our room was pleasantly heated the modern way, and not drafty in the slightest despite the blizzard outside our windows.

And speaking of those windows: we had 2. One of them looked out over the lake, and the other led to a little patio that gazed directly out onto the street below. So no matter which way I turned, there was snow, and mountains, and Hallstatt, and heaven.

We highly recommend staying at the [**Bräu-Gasthof**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/booking?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fat%2Fbra-ugasthof-hallstatt.xu.html%3Faid%3D1321795%26no_rooms%3D1%26group_adults%3D1) during your trip to Hallstatt. The location is excellent, the food is delicious, the room is comfortable, and the views are to die for!

I couldn’t stop staring out the windows in glee, watching the snow pile up outside, pointing frantically and saying things like “JEREMY LOOK” and “DO YOU SEE HOW MUCH SNOW THERE IS JEREMY” and bouncing up and down and pressing my face up against the glass.

Snow turns me into a 6 year old, and I could hardly make myself go to sleep. I was way too excited to wake up to a fresh blanket of white, powdery snow and a new place to discover.

![Christmas Decorations in Hallstatt, Austria.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Christmas-Decorations.jpg)
Me, the entire trip: JEREMY LOOK JEREMY CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS LOOK JEREMY LOOK

Those of you who have spent more than 5 seconds browsing the blog probably already know that Jeremy and I are NOT Morning People. We’re not even Mid-Morning People. We’re like, Late Morning/Early Afternoon People, and that’s really only if we can get some coffee in us by 10am.

But in Hallstatt? **In Hallstatt, I was totally a Morning Person.**

![How could anyone sleep when there is SNOW FALLING and EXPLORING to be done?!](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Exploring.jpg)

How could anyone sleep when there is SNOW FALLING and EXPLORING to be done?!

I swear I woke up like 83 times throughout the night so I could glance out the window to confirm that 1) it was still snowing and 2) it wasn’t time to wake up yet.

And then, FINALLY, at 6am (!!!) I could no longer contain myself. The first light of dawn was poking its head around an Alp as if to say “hey, y’all, come on out!”

I bolted out of bed like a kid on Christmas Morning _(as opposed to the week before in Vienna, when it was actually Christmas Morning, and I slept in until noon. But I’m blaming that one on jet lag.)_ 

![Snowy houses freshly covered in snow on a quiet morning in Hallstatt, Austria in winter!](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Snowy-Houses.jpg)
Snowy houses freshly covered in snow on a quiet morning in Hallstatt, Austria in winter!

Sure enough, the town was covered in fresh, glorious, undisturbed snow. No crowds in sight. Just us, some swans, and a whole Austrian village to explore.

I dragged Jeremy out of bed and threw on as many layers as I could reach.

Within 5 minutes flat I was outside, breathing in the chilly mountain air and thinking to myself “this is it, I’m starting my life as a Morning Person TODAY.”

(_Spoilers: the minute we left Hallstatt I returned to my natural state as highly nocturnal and completely unable to wake up before 9am.)_

## Exploring Hallstatt, Austria in a Day

One of the biggest questions on our mind when we were planning our trip was “how much time should we spend in Hallstatt?”

We opted for 1 full day of exploring, and 2 nights of sleeping in town. **If we were to do it again, we’d give ourselves 2 full days.** Still, it’s possible to see the village itself in a day.

Even though we had a full day to explore, we got started early. We took a morning walk at 6am _(seriously, who ARE we?!) through_ the newly snow-dusted streets, fresh powder crunching under our feet in the calm, peaceful, and blissfully empty town.

There were just a few other visitors out walking around and snapping photos – it seemed like they were all actual Morning People, not just Hallstatt Morning People, damn them – but other than that, we had the town all to ourselves.

We took a lap around the Marketplatz and said good morning to some swans (_and then named them Sven Swan, Svlad Swan, and Stephen Swan)_ before heading back to the Bräu-Gasthof to enjoy an incredibly filling breakfast. Because there are no breakfasts in the world better than Austrian breakfasts. Fact.

![A winter morning in Hallstatt, Austria. Just us, the snow, and Sven, Svlad, and Stephen Swan.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Swans.jpg)
A winter morning in Hallstatt, Austria. Just us, the snow, and Sven, Svlad, and Stephen Swan.

Although Hallstatt is small, it is popular, and the tour buses full of visitors began arriving around 9am, just as we were finishing breakfast. I’m so grateful to my internal clock for adjusting itself this one time so I could explore the town early in the morning, and I advise any visitors to Hallstatt to do the same: wake up early! You’ll be glad you did.

But if you’re visiting Hallstatt on a day trip, here’s one more tip to avoid the crowds: start climbing!

Walking through Hallstatt, you’ll come across several little staircases that lead up the mountain that this little village is built into. Climb up them, and you’ll soon find yourself above the crowds and exploring some cozy, quiet, blissfully empty little paths.

![Exploring the old houses in Hallstatt, Austria in the winter, one of the best day trips from Vienna.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girl-Exploring-Hallstatt-Austria.jpg)
Here’s a tip to avoid the crowds in Hallstatt, Austria: if you see a staircase, climb it! You’ll soon lose the crowds down below and be rewarded for your efforts with stunning views of the town.

Hallstatt is full of tiny paths and little corners to explore, and the crowds tend to stay down near the main road. That’s a mistake! We spent much of our day climbing up as far as we could go and exploring the quieter side of Hallstatt.  _Just don’t, ya know, trespass. Stairs are publicly available for you to enjoy – people’s homes are off limit._

Another benefit? Continuously climbing tiny staircases helped us stay warm. Just don’t forget to pack some snow-proof shoes – our sherpa-lined waterproof leather boots from Vivobarefoot kept our feet warm and dry _(these are_ _[mine](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/vivobarefoot-gobi-boot/?clickref=hallstatt-austria-in-w_amcid-oFzbVAePVJFPzM2QbPFOm "VivoBarefoot Gobi Winter Boot") & these are [Jeremy’s](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/vivobarefoot-gobi-ii-mens/?clickref=hallstatt-austria-in-w_amcid-OeMgONF2g2JpzEFYEBNpP "VivoBarefoot Gobi II Mens"))._

![Frozen waterfalls in Hallstatt, Austria.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Frozen-Waterfall.jpg)
Of course there’s a frozen waterfall. Every good fairytale mountain town has a frozen waterfall. That’s just like, the rule.

## Things to Do in Hallstatt in the Winter

Before our visit, we were wondering if there’s actually enough to _do_ in Hallstatt to keep us occupied for an entire day. Hallstatt is a sleepy village – there is no nightlife to be had, few “activities” are possible in the winter, whereas in the summertime, there are tons of outdoorsy opportunities like [hiking in Hallstatt](https://dachstein.salzkammergut.at/en/hiking-trails-goisern-gosau-hallstatt-obertraun.html) or [boating in Lake Hallstatt](https://www.hallstatt.net/about-hallstatt/active-summer-holiday/captain-for-the-day/?source=side), plus you can even [tour the salt mine.](https://www.salzwelten.at/en/hallstatt/)

However, exploring and wandering on foot and taking photos and eating and naming swans is actually plenty to keep us occupied.

Sure, “just walk around and look at stuff” may sound like a snooze, but actually, it’s one of our favorite ways to travel! We could have spent several happy days simply soaking in the views and breathing the fresh mountain air and making snow angels.

That said, if would have had 2 days in Hallstatt, we would have spent one of them at **[Dachstein Krippenstein](https://dachstein-salzkammergut.com/en/)**, skiing or snowboarding or snow-shoeing or exploring the **[giant Ice Cave](https://dachstein-salzkammergut.com/en/summer/below-ground/dachstein-giant-ice-cave/)** (!!!!!!). But sadly, we only had 1 day to spend exploring the town on foot. Obviously, we’ll have to come back.

![Hallstatt, Austria is built right into the side of a mountain and is criss-crossed with little staircases and walking-only paths. The higher you climb up the icy stairs, the emptier the streets are and the better the views!](https://practicalwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hallstatt-Austria-in-Winter-Snowy-Hills.jpg)

## The History of Hallstatt, Austria

After hours of exploring the town on foot, we headed back down to the main square to warm up in the [Hallstatt Museum](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8242832-11552042?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FAttraction_Review-g190427-d1901355-Reviews-Museum_Hallstatt-Hallstatt_Upper_Austria.html&sid=hallstattaustriainwinter_amcid-gsQQOY373OM2rzYxzZEbP) and learn about the history of Hallstatt, because we’re nerds and we enjoy context.

The history of Hallstatt dates wayyyyy back to before the current town was built. Excavations and archeological sites place the first settlers near Hallstatt as early as 7,000 years ago.

These prehistoric settlers did something truly amazing: they founded **the world’s first salt mine**. _(Well, scientifically speaking, it’s the world’s first \*known\* salt mine, but still, DAYYUUMMMM!)_

Trying to imagine what this view must looked like 700 years ago … or 7,000 years ago.

These lucky settlers had deliciously seasoned food and some of the best views in the world, so they stayed. And stayed.

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://b92d0af8e5ee68707ba41d9c3960ad75.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html" id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006,22660292004/practicalwanderlust/content_21" title="3rd party ad content" name="" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="1" height="1" data-is-safeframe="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="attribution-reporting" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-google-container-id="q" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 250px; width: 300px;" data-load-complete="true" data-hooks="true"></iframe>

And for century after century, the residents of this salt-rich little valley lived a comfortable life, shielded from whatever else was going on in the world, content to mine their salt and then sell it at exorbitant prices to the rest of the world.

The villagers of Hallstatt enjoyed a life of luxury, no matter who they were or who they were governed by: Celtics, Romans, Austrians, and so on.

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://b92d0af8e5ee68707ba41d9c3960ad75.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html" id="google_ads_iframe_/1030006,22660292004/practicalwanderlust/content_22" title="3rd party ad content" name="" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="1" height="1" data-is-safeframe="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="attribution-reporting" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-google-container-id="r" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; height: 250px; width: 300px;" data-load-complete="true" data-hooks="true"></iframe>

There was, however, the occasional fire, wiping out the existing village and requiring a newly constructed one. That explains why the Hallstatt of today is so “young” compared to the age that the area has been inhabited (_of course, as residents of USA, a tiny baby country with tiny baby buildings, 700+ years is still a mind-bogglingly long period of time)._

Just lookin’ adorable and being mushy in a snowy mountain town, living my dream life.

After the museum, we continued exploring Hallstatt on foot, tasting some samples of local _zirbenschnaps,_ which is Schnapps made out of pinecones. It tastes like mountain air and Christmas and evergreen forests.

We browsed some gift shops, purchasing a few hand-made wooden Christmas ornaments and some locally mined bath salts.

And of course, we threw snowballs at each other. #marriage

### How to get from Vienna to Hallstatt

-   **Getting from Vienna to Hallstatt by train:**  In Vienna, head to either **Hauptbahnhof** or **Westbahnhof** station. Take an Austria National OBB train to **Attnang-Puchheim**, which takes around 2 hours. Once you reach Attnang-Puchheim station, you’ll need to transfer to a regional train heading directly to Hallstatt.  Your regional train will take you through scenic Austrian countryside for about 85 minutes before depositing you at tiny **Hallstatt Markt** station across the lake from Hallstatt. Walk down the path and take the ferry into town. Because Vienna and Hallstatt are so close, make sure take advantage of Vienna in wintertime with this [ultimate Vienna Christmas guide](https://practicalwanderlust.com/vienna-in-winter-christmas/)!

### How to get from Salzburg to Hallstatt

-   **Getting from Salzburg to Hallstatt by train:** This trip is much the same as the journey from Vienna, but shorter.  From Salzburg, take an Austria National OBB train to **Attnang-Puchheim**, which takes around an hour. Once you reach Attnang-Puchheim station, you’ll need to transfer to a regional train heading directly to Hallstatt.  Your regional train will take you through scenic Austrian countryside for about 85 minutes before depositing you at tiny **Hallstatt Markt** station across the lake from Hallstatt. Walk down the path and take the ferry into town!
-   **Getting from Salzburg to Hallstatt by bus & train:** We hear this route is actually more scenic than the train route, although we haven’t personally tried it. In Salzburg, head to the bus terminal – it’s just outside of the doors of the main train station in **Südtiroler Platz**. Take bus #150 heading to **Bad Ischl**. In Bad Ischl, hop off the bus, head inside the train staton (_the bus terminal is just outside of it_) and take a regional train the rest of the way to Hallstatt.
-   Your regional train will take you through scenic Austrian countryside for about 85 minutes before depositing you at tiny **Hallstatt Markt** station across the lake from Hallstatt. Walk down the path and take the ferry into town!

We’re OBSESSED with our winter boots _(and yes, we both have the same ones. Because we’re gross like that_). They’re cute, they’re insanely comfortable, they’re waterproof leather and lined with shearling to keep your toes toasty warm, and they’re extremely lightweight and foldable so you can stuff them in your bag when you travel. Oh, and they have thin and flexible soles that let your feet function as if you were walking around in freezing cold Hallstatt completely barefoot!  _Note: you might find yourself in need of some calf strengthening before your trip if you’re not used to barefoot-style soles._ We can’t recommend these boots enough. They’re made to last and they’re worth every cent – we wear them damn near every day when it’s cold out. We even went snow-shoeing in them once. They are tried & true! Here are [my boots](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/vivobarefoot-gobi-boot?clickref=hallstatt-austria-in-w_amcid-iEg3Qp3bobsiVpqFzliPI "VivoBarefoot Gobi Winter Boot") and [Jeremy’s boots](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/gobi-ii-boots-mens?clickref=hallstatt-austria-in-w_amcid-lIsZYlFMFx3PzFYbBBM33 "Gobi II Boots Mens Casual Canvas Boot"). You can read more about them in our round-up of our favorite [travel shoes for women](https://practicalwanderlust.com/best-womens-travel-shoes/) or [for men.](https://practicalwanderlust.com/best-travel-shoes-for-men/)
-   [**Wool Socks**](https://amzn.to/2Q3lzQL "Darn Tough Wool Socks Womens"): Run-of-the-mill acrylic or cotton socks won’t keep your feet warm while you’re exploring Hallstatt.Make sure you get socks that are primarily made of soft, heat-regulating wool, like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Light-Hiker-Cushion/dp/B07N1TYCSN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07QSWB4FD&pd_rd_r=53448184-29ee-4acc-ba8c-ae0552d03cbe&pd_rd_w=KWnBa&pd_rd_wg=H4Ffa&pf_rd_p=703f3758-d945-4136-8df6-a43d19d750d1&pf_rd_r=RVS56EF0RY019HV8RABW&refRID=RVS56EF0RY019HV8RABW&th=1&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=practicalwanderlust-20&linkId=6119a92395656f5a1f0202faf67cfa4e&language=en_US "Wool Everyday Socks Men") or [these](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/wool-everyday-socks-womens/ "Wool Everyday Socks Womens").

One of my personal woes is the lack of pockets on women’s jeans. But thankfully, our travel jeans have 6 POCKETS – and they’re all luxuriously large and roomy, too! They’re super stretchy and buttery soft, dry quickly in the rain or when wet, and keep our legs warm when it’s cold out. They’re cozy enough to wear on a plane, stretchy enough to accommodate that 5 extra pounds of holiday weight I always seem to bring back home with me, and they’re super cute! We’re both obsessed. You can get a pair of men’s or women’s black jeans (_my personal favorites_) on the [**Aviator USA website.**](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/aviator-usa/?subid=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-QoxMrY6r7lebeUgOrOI2b "Aviator USA")

-   **[Wool Undershirt](https://amzn.to/3j8QesP "Wool Cami"):** Laying is crucial when it’s this cold. My favorite way to make sure I stay warm all day is to put a warm layer of wool on before everything else. This is the [wool cami](https://amzn.to/3j8QesP "Wool Cami") I wear, and this is the [wool t-shirt](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/wool-crew-neck-t-shirt-mens?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-zOIeYVex6UroAP7pUPOAe "Wool Crew Neck T Shirt Mens") Jeremy wears.
-   [**Wool Leggings**](https://amzn.to/3WWraJU "Merino Wool Base Layer Leggings Womens"): These super comfy 100% wool leggings function just like long underwear. Except they’re made of soft, super-luxurious wool instead of cheap polyester, and make your legs feel like they’re being hugged by an extremely soft sheep. I wore a pair of these under my pants every single day and they kept me toasty warm (_without being too hot)!_ Jeremy has [this pair](https://amzn.to/3tu2Xx8 "Merino Wool Base Layer Leggings Mens"), too. **Bonus**: they also double as the world’s coziest lounge leggings or even sleepwear!
-   **[Warm Leggings (with pockets!)](https://amzn.to/3hzTqBQ "Royal Robbins Lucerne Pant"):** Although we bring our wool leggings to layer under our pants, I also bring a pair of regular leggings – you know, for when it’s a balmy 40 degrees in the sun. I love these pants because they actually look like pants, not leggings – and they have ZIPPERED POCKETS!!!! Not those stupid pockets that can fit like, a chapstick and 3 dimes – you can actually zip a phone in there. BLESS.
-   **[Flannel Shirt:](https://amzn.to/3TufUkV "Royal Robbins MerinoLux Flannel Womens")** I’m in LOVE with the MerinoLux flannel button-downs from Royal Robbins. They’re stretchy, they’re cozy, they’re blended with merino wool  (_yassss_) and most importantly, they’re warm AF. But not so warm that you’ll get all sweaty running around Europe and exploring, because they’re also super breathable. They’re also wrinkle resistant, odor resistant, and moisture wicking, and have a hidden zip pocket – so basically everything you could ever ask for in a flannel shirt. I’ve been searching for the perfect flannel for YEARS _(you know, one that didn’t give me button-down boob gap and allowed me to actually cross my arms)_ and this is The One. I love it! Here’s [mine](https://amzn.to/3TufUkV "Royal Robbins MerinoLux Flannel Womens") and [Jeremy’s](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/mens-merinolux/ "Mens MerinoLux").

-   **[Day Bag](https://amzn.to/3xJhFB9 "Cute Day Bag"):** I carried this day bag with me every single day packed with my [packable down jacket](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/packable-down-jacket-womens?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-J2MJ3m6ZqqJ7qOEzElzir "Packable Down Jacket Womens"), an extra pair of gloves, and anything else I needed for the day – a notebook, a water bottle, an endless supply of snacks, whatever. Jeremy carried our camera gear [in this bag](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/pacsafe-camera-bag/?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-E7E2ipexleQbYBYlElqrx "Pacsafe Camera Bag") along with his [packable down jacket](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/packable-down-jacket-mens/?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-Zq7pmqIIsJOUz3giJlsxV "Packable Down Jacket Mens") and scarf.
-   **[Warm Hat](https://amzn.to/2ylRPWD "Womans Winter Hat 1"):** A warm hat is an absolute necessity in chilly Hallstatt in the winter. It also doubles as a super cute accessory! You want a hat that will stay on your head even in blustery gusts of wind, so stay away from those wool felt ~travel girl types of hats and stick with reliable beanies. Personally I’m a fan of the ones with poofs on top, like [this](https://amzn.to/2ylRPWD "Womans Winter Hat 1") or [this](https://amzn.to/2yDRr6C "Womans Winter Hat 2"). Jeremy is more of a purist, and likes to wear beanies like [this](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/mens-beanie?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-33xZz3QziNNppQ2i6Pzxe "Mens Beanie") or [this](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/mens-beanie/?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-rQEIPOMNZmgzgmZxioOMl "Mens Beanie").
-   **[Warm Coat](https://amzn.to/3HbfhsH "Wool A-Line Coat"):** Like good warm shoes, a warm winter coat is absolutely necessary for chilly Hallstatt in December & January. I brought 2 coats with me to Europe: a beautiful camel-colored A-line wool coat [like this one](https://amzn.to/3HbfhsH "Wool A-Line Coat") that kept me incredibly warm and looked amazing in all of my pictures, and a travel-friendly [packable down jacket](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/packable-down-jacket-womens?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-PgrBJibEoPMF3igiFEzNJ "Packable Down Jacket Womens") that I kept stuffed in my daypack in case I needed an extra layer! Jeremy wore a peacoat [like this one](https://amzn.to/3GcqXw4 "Mens Winter Coat 1").

-   [**Scarves**](https://amzn.to/2PtVpVQ "Blanket Scarf"): I LOVE a chunky scarf. They’re my favorite accessory! And you will absolutely need a good scarf in Europe. I love [this super soft scarf](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/royal-robbins-highland-scarf?ctc=hallstatt-austria-in-winter_amcid-bUmQYJeepMJpMUPqPErOA "Royal Robbins Highland Scarf") from Royal Robbins, which is blended with wool and turns into a cute shawl or infinity scarf with a few well-placed buttons. I’m also a big fan of scarves that are big enough to double as blankets, like [this one](https://amzn.to/2NbnctU "Womens Chunky Scarf 1") or [this one](https://amzn.to/2PtVpVQ "Blanket Scarf").
-   [**Gloves**](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/wool-gloves/ "Wool Gloves"): Don’t go outside in Hallstatt without gloves on! You will regret it. You will regret it. I love [these wool gloves](https://practicalwanderlust.com/recommends/wool-gloves/ "Wool Gloves") that work with touchscreens, because let’s face it, I have a hard enough time using my phone without wearing gloves.

Here are our favorite travel tips & resources for saving money and planning travel logistics! For more tips, check out [our travel tips resource page](https://practicalwanderlust.com/travel-tips/) or our [guide to planning a trip](https://practicalwanderlust.com/how-to-plan-a-trip-travel-planning-tips/).

-   **Booking Flights**: To score flight deals, search on Google Flights or [**Kayak**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/kayak?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kayak.com%2Fflights). Money-saving tips: fly mid-week or on the weekend; fly carry-on only on a budget airline; and take red-eyes or early morning flights.
-   **Accommodations:** We usually stay in budget-friendly vacation rentals, boutique hotels or private rooms in hostels. We use [**Booking.com**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/booking?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.html%3Faid%3D1321795) to book hotels (_we love their flexible cancellation policy_) and [**Hostelworld**](https://hostelworld.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lII8/pubref:ResourceBox/ar:ResourceBox/[p_id:1100l15345]) to book hostels (_low deposit, easy change/cancellation, and excellent reviews)_. For vacation rentals, we prefer to book using [**VRBO**](https://www.stay22.com/allez/vrbo?aid=practicalwanderlustllc&campaign=practicalwanderlust-hallstattaustriainwinter&product=lma&habl=false&isinc=false&sid22=3c87e381-4661-4feb-97f1-ffcf0b82c24f&source=direct&medium=deeplink&address=Hallstatt%2C+Austria&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2F%3Fcid%3Dl_ha3pd-affiliate-6_%26cur%3DUSD%26clickref%3D1011lyr58maV%26CID%3Da_ph_6%26utm_source%3Daff_ph%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_campaign%3Dstay22_1101l252%26utm_content%3D0%26k_clickid%3D1011lyr58maV%26affcid%3DVRBO-US.DIRECT.PHG.1011l45458 "VRBO") because they've got lower fees and better support than Airbnb, and we're not fans of Airbnb's unethical track record.

    Great post and photos! Just curious, what dates were you in Hallstatt? Cause the town streets in your photos look so quiet and empty! We were just in Hallstatt right after Christmas season for 2 days on the 26th & 27th and were shocked that there ended up being several thousand people in the village each day. We found that exploring before 10am or late in the evening was the best time since day travelers hadn’t arrived to the village yet or had left the village.

        Hey Jake, that’s exactly when we were there! Just after Christmas and before New Years. And yes, we took our photos early in the morning or later in the evening after the crowds cleared out. We are were glad we stayed overnight so we got to enjoy Hallstatt sans crowds!

    I gotta tell you, I am sitting in bed in a rehab in South New Jersey, waiting to have my hip replaced. I needed an uplift to my day, and I came across your vacation. Holy Crap Lea !!!!! What a great trip I had right here from my bed !!!!! I loved every minute of it. I am a real snow spirit and I could smell the air and feel the new snow beneath my feet all through your entries. Thank you so much for enlightening this 71 year old woman on beautiful Hallstatt Austria. Maybe its because I have some Austrian in me that helped me to enjoy your trip with you guys…or…maybe it’s just that excitement and overall love for what you were doing that was contagious. At any rate, thanks again, I had a great time. Please feel free to send me any other stories and photos of more of the same. I LOVE SNOW!!!!!

    Were shops and restaurants open while you were there? We are spending Christmas Eve through the 27th there and I’m hoping there will be restaurants open during the holidays!

        We visited just after Christmas. I’m not sure when they take it down, but honestly I still think Hallstatt would be just as stunning at anytime during the winter, even without that Christmas tree!

        Hey Bernade, we certainly aren’t experts but I would say that the main road of Hallstatt is wheelchair accessible. I don’t recall whether many places had stairs to get inside, but the main road through town is mostly flat & wide enough for a wheelchair – just be careful to avoid icy areas, of course! You’ll have difficulty exploring the town by stairs but you can still get a great view overlooking the town via car – there’s a parking lot with some amazing views. I would also advise against taking the ferry to get across the lake, as it’s not only a tricky, icy path to get to the ferry but I doubt it would be very easy to board & offboard with a wheelchair – you’d want to enter by car on the other side. I’m actually not sure though whether you can get from that entrance to the main road in town without stairs… hmm. You know, I’d really recommend reaching out to the tourism board to ask them about this, I think they might be able to give you some better advice! Here’s their website: [https://dachstein-salzkammergut.com/](https://dachstein-salzkammergut.com/)

    Your snowy photos are so absolutely dreamy <3 I especially love all your advice on where to stay because I'd love to stay here overnight instead of making it a day trip!

    Hallstatt looks so beautiful! Especially in the snow. Wonderful photos! Did you find there was still a lot to do there in winter?

        There is not as much to do in the winter as there is in summer, but there’s still plenty to fill a few days! You can go skiing, explore an ice cave, tour the Hallstatt museum, or just do what we did: run around in the snow taking pictures and making snow angels and eating delicious food and generally entertaining ourselves 🙂

    Holy sh\*it I now want to go to Hallstatt. Actually, I MUST go. In about an hour I will be googling flights and hotels and convincing my husband that it’s totally normal to book a random winter weekend trip 10 months in advance.

    Wow – Hallstatt looks so picturesque! I’m not normally a snow and mountains type of girl but the snow just has a way of making everything look EXTRA pretty. I’m thinking we need to add a winter European trip to our bucketlist!  
    I love all your photos! And thank you for sharing what to pack for this trip because I really don’t know how to dress for super cold weather! lol Pinning this for the bucketlist 😉

    Oh my goodness, Hallstatt does look like a fairytale town!! I’m done with winter for this year (it’s FINALLY warming up for spring here in Finland), but one day I definitely want to experience wintery Hallstatt. Especially the pinecone scnapps, because that sounds amazing.

    Great post 🙂 Love your sense of humor. Hallstatt was one of the highlights of my mini Europe trip last winter. We only stayed for a day (morning till afternoon) though, so I would love to go back one day… maybe in the summer when we can row a boat on the lake!
